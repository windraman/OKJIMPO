The effect of selecting varying numbers and kinds of fea- tures for use in predicting category membership was inves- tigated on the Reuters and MUC-3 text categorization data sets.
The extraction of new text features by syntactic analysis and feature clustering was investigated on the Reuters data set.
However, words have properties, such as synonymy and polysemy, that make them a less than ideal indexing language.
Syntactic phrase indexing and term clustering have op- posite effects on the properties of a text representation, which led us t o  investigate combining the two techniques [3].
However, the small size of standard text retrieval test collections, and the variety of approaches available for query interpretation, made it difficult to  study purely representational issues in text retrieval experiments.
