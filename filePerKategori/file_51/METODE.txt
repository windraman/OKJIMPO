In order to examinethe properties of these seven techniques we performed a seriesof similarity and classi?cation experiments on eleven DNAmicroarray datasets.
This paper presents a set of seven univariate featureselection techniques which we have combined into a familyof techniques we name First Order Statistics (FOS) basedfeature selection.
Our group decided to use twelvefeature subset sizes for this experiment: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50,75, 100, 200, 350, 500, and 1000.
We decided to use consistency index [4] because it takesinto consideration bias due to chance.
In this study we use three different classi?ers or learnersto evaluate the classi?cation power of the seven FOS rankers.
The three classi?ers used in this study are SVM, LogisticRegression, and Random Forest.
