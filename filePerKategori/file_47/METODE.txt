In this paper we propose a novel relation extraction method, based on grammatical inference.
Following a semi-supervised learning approach, the text that connects named entities in an annotated corpus is used to infer a context free grammar.
In this paper, a supervised machine learning approach is proposed.
Assuming the existence of a named entity recogniser (NERC), the proposed approach extracts binary relations between named entities already identified in texts.
The approach presented in this paper concentrates on extracting binary relations from textual corpora, by trying to capture the linguistic evidence in the text that connects two related entities.
All pages have been manually annotated, according to a semantic model capturing information about athletes and their participations in sports competitions, held under official competitions.
