In this section we present our algorithm for assigning oneof 15 section types. 
We hypothesize that section sequences can improve theaccuracy of section label classi?cation.
Finally, we have assumed that text span boundaries inclinical notes are known, which is unusual in practice. Inorder to improve the accuracy of the classi?er, a future di-rection for this study is to segment and classify text spansat the same time.
