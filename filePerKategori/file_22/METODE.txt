Conditional Random Fields
 METHOD: Formalizingthe categorization task as a sequential label-ing problem, we employ Conditional Ran-dom Fields (CRFs) to annotate section la-bels into abstract sentences.
RESULTS: The pro-posed method outperformed the previousapproaches, achieving 95.5% per-sentenceaccuracy and 68.8% per-abstract accuracy.
We design three kinds of features to represent eachabstract sentence for CRFs.
We constructed two sets of corpora (‘pure’ and ‘ex-panded’), each of which contains 51,000 abstractssampled from the abstracts with structured sections.
We utilized FlexCRFs4 implementation to builda classifier with linear-chain CRFs.
