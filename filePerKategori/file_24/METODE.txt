Multilayer Perceptron  
This paper presents the implementation of bottom up approach to segment the document image into homogenous regions based on geometric structure. 
The proposed approach reduces the computational complexities of supporting procedure after document segmentation such as OCR system for processing text regions and for processing non text region.
