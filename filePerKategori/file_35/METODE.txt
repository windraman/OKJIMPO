In particular, wetackle relation extraction and entity identifi-cation jointly.
We use distant supervision totrain a factor graph model for relation ex-traction based on an existing knowledge base(Freebase, derived in parts from Wikipedia).
For inference we run an efficient Gibbs sam-pler that leads to linear time joint inference.
It is based on an undirected graphical modelin which variables correspond to facts, and factorsbetween them measure compatibility.
Akin to previous work inrelation extraction with distant supervision, we re-quire no annotated text.
However, instead extract-ing facts in isolation, we model interactions betweenfacts in order to improve precision.
In particular, wecapture selectional preferences of relations.
Thesepreferences are modelled in a cross-document fash-ion using a large scale factor graph.
