Wetranslate queries with Google Translate and extend them with new trans-lations obtained by mapping noun phrases in the query to concepts inthe target language using Wikipedia.
As a baseline CLIR model, we use query translation byGoogle Translate.
To exploit this, we mine allredirect and cross-language links to build a translation table which maps con-cepts to their target language equivalent.
To map queries to Wikipedia concepts (titles), we first try to map thewhole query, and then gradually proceed with mapping shorter word sequences.
In this study, we introduced a simple CLIR model using Wikipedia, mappingconcepts in one language to their equivalents in another language based on theredirect and cross-language links in multilingual Wikipedia versions.
