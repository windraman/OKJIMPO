When we have an empirical knowledge about the classes assigned to the samples in the training set, we say that the learning problem has a supervised nature. If the samples are not labeled, the learning problem is considered as unsupervised. In many application problems there is available a significant amount of unlabelled data, and only few labeled samples. The introduction of such few labels can improve the classification accuracy significantly [17]. We will refer to this problem as semi-supervised learning and it has recently received an increased interest in the pattern recognition and machine learning communities.
We focus on the application problems where the unlabeled information can improve in a significant way the classification result of just using the limited labeled samples available.
