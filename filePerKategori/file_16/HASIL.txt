 In these cases, the unsupervised information improves the accuracy and the ssfc method is adequate (see gisette in figure 1). Optdigits is a database where sup technique gets high-quality features for few labeled samples. Thus, in this case the ssfc has similar performance than sup. Nevertheless when the number of labeled samples is increased, ssfc and sup become similar to supT.
