For the experimentation the following datasets have been chosen of the UCI repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). • Gisette is a big data in the UCI repository, with 5000 attributes and 13500 objects, 7000 of them labelled. It is a handwritten digit recognition problem; and the task is to discriminate between the four and the nine numbers. It has artificial attributes that are randomly generated, and the values are rather sparse, about 13% of the values are non-zero. In the experiments, only the first 500 features with the highest entropy were used. • Optdigits problem is about the recognition of a handwritten number. The database has 5620 samples and 64 features. The 32x32 bitmaps are divided into no overlapping blocks of 4x4 and the number of pixels is counted in each block. This generates an input matrix of 8x8 (64 features) where each value is an integer in the range 0..16.  • In covtype database, the objective is predicting forest cover type from cartographic variables, with no remotely sensed data. This database has 54 features, 581012 objects and 7 classes. A hyperspectral image called 92AV3C [9] has also been used, corresponding to a spectral image (145 x 145 pixels, 220 bands, and 17 classes) acquired with the AVIRIS, in June 1992, over the Indian Pine Test, in Northwestern Indiana. (http:/dynamo.ecn.purdue.edu/?biehl/MultiSpec) It has also pixels with an undetermined class. In this hyperspectral image several bands are discarded due to the effect of atmospheric absorption; 185 of the original 220 bands were used discarding the lowest signal-to-noise ratio bands.
