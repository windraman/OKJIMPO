Our goal is to automatically detect boundaries between discussionsof different topics in meetings.
Our goal as a part of the CALO project1 is to automatically un-derstand discussions at meetings.

In this paper we describe ourcurrent work on the first question – the detection of boundariesbetween different topics of discussion in meetings.
