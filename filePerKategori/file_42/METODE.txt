Towards this end we adapt theTextTiling algorithm [1] to the context of meetings.
Our featuresinclude not only the overlapped words between adjacent windows,but also overlaps in the amount of speech contributed by eachmeeting participant.
We base our algorithm on Marti Hearstâ€™s TextTiling[1] algorithm where the probability that a point in a text essay isa topic boundary is computed based on the similarity between thewords in windows to the left and right of that point.
