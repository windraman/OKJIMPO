This paper presents a supervised method for the detection and extraction of Causal Relations from open domain text. 
Our approach first identifies the syntactic patterns that may encode acausation, then we use Machine Learning techniques to decide whether or not a pattern instance encodes a causation
Our method for the detection and extraction of causationsis based on the use of syntactic patterns that may encodecausation.
