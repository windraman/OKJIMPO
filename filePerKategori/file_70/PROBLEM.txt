Our focus in this experiment is on examining search performance of a hybrid approach combining query translation and document translation, in which English is employed as an intermediary language for translation.
Some researchers have already attempted to merge two results from query and document translation for enhancing effectiveness of CLIR.
One problem for implementing this approach is that the document translation is usually a cost-intensive task, but we can alleviate it by using simpler translation techniques, e.g., “pseudo translation” [1] in which each term is simply replaced with its corresponding translations by a bilingual dictionary.
