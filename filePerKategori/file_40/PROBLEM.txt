Feature selection and extraction are frequently used solutions to overcome the curse of dimensionality intext classi?cation problems.
In vector space, we representthe documents with terms, which is also known as the bag-of-words model.
The nature of the bag-of-wordsapproach causes a very high dimensional and sparse feature space.
It is hard to build an e?cient model for text classi?cation in this high dimensional featurespace.
Due to this problem, dimension reduction has become one of the key problems of textual informationprocessing and retrieval [4].
