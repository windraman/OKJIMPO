Results show that our summarizing abstractfeature extraction method encouragingly enhances classi?cation performances on most of the classi?ers whencompared with other methods.
 Comparisonand test results show that the AFE scores the highest F1 measure on the Reuters dataset with 96.9%, the 20Newsgroups dataset with 94.8%, and the ModApte-10 with 96.1%.
This means that the AFE achieves a betterF1 measure of 3.7% on the Reuters, 19.4% on the 20 Newsgroups, and 3.4% on the ModApte-10 than its nearestfollowing non-AFE method.
Looking at the average F1 measures of the classi?ers, we see that the AFEâ€™s scoreis 9.2% higher on Reuters, 33.0% higher on 20 Newsgroups, and 7.3% higher on ModApte-10 than the next bestscored method.
