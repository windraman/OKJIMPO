We introduce an extraction method that summarizes the features of the documentsamples, where the new features aggregate information about how much evidence there is in a document, foreach class.
We project the high dimensional features of documents onto a new feature space having dimensionsequal to the number of classes in order to form the abstract features.
In this paper, we propose a supervised feature extraction method, which produces the extractedfeatures by combining the e?ects of the input features over classes.
The method we provide, the abstract feature extractor (AFE), is a supervised feature extraction algorithm thatproduces the extracted features by combining the e?ects of the input features over classes.
Input features are projected to a suppositious featurespace using the probabilistic distribution of the features over classes.
We project the probabilities of the featuresto classes and sum up these probabilities to get the impact of each feature to each class.
In the AFE, we combine the in-class term frequencies given in Eq. (22) with inverse document frequenciesand use this scheme to weight the e?ects of terms on the classes, as in Eq. (23).
