This method works by first fac-toring all complex relations into a set of binary re-lations.
A classifier is then trained in the standardmanner to recognize all pairs of related entities.
Fi-nally a graph is constructed from the output of thisclassifier and the complex relations are determinedfrom the cliques of this graph.
Instead of trying to classify all possible relationinstances, in this work we first classify pairs of en-tities as being related or not.
Then, as discussed inSection 4.2, we reconstruct the larger complex rela-tions from a set of binary relation instances.
Instead of having the system re-turn all cliques, our system just returns the maximalcliques, that is, those cliques that are not subsets ofother cliques.
