In this section, an efficient linear text segmentation algorithm (called TSHAC), which considers both computational complexity and segmentation accuracy, is proposed. The process of TSHAC consists of 4 steps. At first, a long text is preprocessed; tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming are conducted to construct the vocabulary of the text. After text preprocessing, the text can be represented as vectors, each of which represents a sentence within the text. A part of sentence similarities are then computed to construct the sentence-similarity matrix. Finally, the optimal topic boundaries are identified by the proposed algorithm.
