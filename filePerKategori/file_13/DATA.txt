To evaluate the performance of TSHAC, a publicly available test corpus is adopted. The test corpus was created by Choi [3] and has been commonly used in previous researches. The test corpus consists of 700 samples. A sample is a concatenation of ten text segments. A segment is the first n sentences of a randomly selected document from the Brown corpus. The 700 samples are divided into 4 sets according to the range of the number of sentences.
