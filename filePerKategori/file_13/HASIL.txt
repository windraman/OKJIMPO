The experimental results in Table II are reported when the number of segments is unknown in advance. From Table II, the proposed linear text segmentation algorithm (i.e., TSHAC) outperforms the linear time algorithm, TextTiling, and the more complex algorithms, C99. TSHAC also provides comparable results with other algorithms. Moreover, unlike TSF, which requires manpower to designate parameters used, TSHAC provides a fully automatic process for linear text segmentation without auxiliary knowledge base, parameter setting, or user involvement.
