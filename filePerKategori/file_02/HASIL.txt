Our experimental results show thatTCFS with CHIR has better clustering accuracy in terms of theF-measure and the purity.
Our experimental results with various real data sets demon-strated that the TCFS algorithm using the CHIR feature selectionmethod performs better than k-means, k-means with the TermStrength (TS) feature selection method [12], the IF method, andTCFS with other supervised feature selection methods in termsof the accuracy of clustering results.
In our research, we found the feature selection method CHIdoes not fully explore all the information provided by the ?2term-category independence test
