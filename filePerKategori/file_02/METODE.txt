Using Statistical Data
 Feature selection is an important method for im-proving the ef?ciency and accuracy of text categorization algo-rithms by removing redundant and irrelevant terms from thecorpus. In this paper, we propose a new supervised featureselection method, named CHIR, which is based on the ?2 statisticand new statistical data that can measure the positive term-category dependency. We also propose a new text clusteringalgorithm TCFS, which stands for Text Clustering with FeatureSelection. TCFS can incorporate CHIR to identify relevantfeatures (i.e., terms) iteratively, and the clustering becomes alearning process.
In this paper, we propose a new supervised featureselection method, named CHIR, which is based on the ?2 statisticand new statistical data that can measure the positive term-category dependency.
In this research, we extended the ?2 term-category indepen-dence test by introducing new statistical data that can measurewhether the dependency between a term and a category is positiveor negative.
We used thecohesiveness of clusters to measure the performance of featureselection methods.
We used the F-measure and the purity to evaluate the accuracy of the clusteringalgorithms.
