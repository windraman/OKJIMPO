We introduce a stochastic graph-based method for computing relative importance oftextual units for Natural Language Processing.
All of ourapproaches are based on the concept of prestige2 in social networks, which has also inspiredmany ideas in computer networks and information retrieval.
We hypothesize that the sentencesthat are similar to many of the other sentences in a cluster are more central (or salient)to the topic.
We define degree centrality of asentence as the degree of the corresponding node in the similarity graph.
When computing degree centrality, we have treated each edge as a vote to determine theoverall centrality value of each node.
