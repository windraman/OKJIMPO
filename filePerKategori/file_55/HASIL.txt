The results show thatdegree-based methods (including LexRank) outperform both centroid-based methods andother systems participating in DUC in most of the cases.
Furthermore, the LexRankwith threshold method outperforms the other degree-based techniques including continuousLexRank.
All of ourthree new methods (Degree, LexRank with threshold, and continuous LexRank) performsignificantly better than the baselines in all data sets.
They also perform better thancentroid-based summaries except for the DUC 2003 data set where the difference betweenCentroid and the others is not obvious.
Lastly, we haveshown that our methods are quite insensitive to noisy data that often occurs as a result ofimperfect topical document clustering algorithms.
