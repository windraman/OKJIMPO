High-Performing Feature Selection
We are concentrating on ?lter methods because 1) theyare more scalable to very large collections and 2) their biasis di?erent from the classi?er’s.
We included several feature selection methods presentedby [12].
We implemented a variant of the µ co-occurence methoddescribed by [10], which uses the other ?lter feature selectionmethods as a starting point.
We selected four high-performing classi?ers for the featureselection experiments:• K-Nearest Neighbors (local implementation)• Naive Bayes (Rainbow, [7])• Rocchio (local implementation)• Support Vector Machines (SVMLight, [3])
