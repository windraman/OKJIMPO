We present gen-eral Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms for estimat-ing pattern and tuple confidence. Our specific contributionsinclude:• A formalization of the pattern confidence estimationproblem (Section 2).?Microsoft Research Email:eugeneag@microsoft.com• A general EM-based method for estimating the confi-dence of automatically generated patterns and the ex-tracted relation tuples (Section 3).• An evaluation of different pattern weighting methodsover multiple relation extraction tasks (Section 5).
