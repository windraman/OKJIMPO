As we can see, both NB-EM and VS-EM-Spyperform on par with the Constraint method on this task.
As we conjectured,for this relation (which lacks true integrity constraints), theEM-based methods have higher accuracy than the constraint-based method.
As we can see in Figure 7,Snowball variations with no specific tuning for DiseaseOut-breaks produce results that are comparable with those forProteus.
In fact, Snowball manages to achieve recall that issubstantially higher than that of Proteus while maintainingcompetitive precision.
We showed that ourgeneral EM-based confidence estimation method improvesextraction accuracy over heuristic-based methods, allowinga partially supervised relation extraction system to achieveaccuracy comparable to a sophisticated manually tuned state-of-the-art information extraction system.
