The approach used in thispaper is based on Hearstâ€™s TextTiling algorithm, a moving window approach that uses lexical overlap as a means ofdetecting topic coherence.
First, it divides the input text intosequences of relevant tokens and calculates the cohesion at each potential boundary point.
It then uses thesecohesion scores to produce depth scores for each potential boundary point that has a lower cohesion than theneighboring boundary points.
Using these depth scores, the algorithm is able to select boundary points where thedepth is low relative to the other depth scores, indicating that that gap represents a topic shift in the text.
The outputis the text file with boundaries inserted at these gaps with sufficiently high depth scores, delineating the varioustopics by breaking at the least cohesive points.
