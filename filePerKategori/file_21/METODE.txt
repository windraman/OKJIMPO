Summarization as Feature Selection
To quantify the arguments advanced in this paper, we con-sidered a number of simple extraction-based techniques ~the details are given in list below.

In allcases, a word occurring at least 3 times in the body of a doc-ument was considered a keyword, while a word occurring atleast once in the title of a story was considered a title word.
