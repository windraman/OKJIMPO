Semantic information was used (1) to enhance adependency tree kernel; and (2) to build semanticdependency structures used for enhanced relationextraction for several semantic classifiers. 
We explored two main resources: PropBank andFrameNet.
We used thesemantic information identified by the parsers in two ways.
Instead of usingthe entire dependency tree to compute similarities, we se-lected sub-trees that contain nodes having values for the fea-tures from set F2 (illustrated in Figure 7).
We used each kernel within an SVM (we augmented theSVMlight implementation to include our kernels).
