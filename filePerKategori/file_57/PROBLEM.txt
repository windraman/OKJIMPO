With the proliferation of on-line systemsserving as personal advisors and assistants, there is a pressing need to develop general and testable computational models forgenerating and presenting evaluative arguments.
Within the framework, we have performed an experiment to test two basic hypotheses on which the design ofthe computational model is based; namely, that our proposal for tailoring an evaluative argument to the addresseeâ€™s preferencesincreases its effectiveness, and that differences in conciseness significantly influence argument effectiveness.
First, because of the complexity of generating natural language, researchershave tended to focus only on specific aspects of the generation process.
Second, because of a lack of systematicevaluation, it is difficult to gauge the effectiveness, scalability and robustness of the proposed approaches.
