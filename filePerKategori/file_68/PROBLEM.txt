A personalized search or filtering system usually suffersfrom the “cold start” problem, where the system performspoorly when it has little training data about new users.
We aim to study a new inter-active user feedback mechanism that helps retrieval systemslearn more about user information needs with limited userinteractions.
This motivates usto explore whether we can adapt the faceted search idea tothe general purpose document retrieval.
First, how to recommend facet-value pairs to users.
Secondly, we study how to useuser faceted feedback in retrieval.
