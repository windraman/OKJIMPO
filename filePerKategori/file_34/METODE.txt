In this paper we propose an SVM based approachto hierarchical relation extraction, using features derived automaticallyfrom a number of GATE-based open-source language processing tools.
In comparison to the previous works, we use several new features includ-ing part of speech tag, entity subtype, entity class, entity role, semanticrepresentation of sentence and WordNet synonym set.
Motivated by the above work, we use the SVM as well and apply a diverseset of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to derive features for relationextraction.
 In particular, several new features are introduced, such as part-of-speech (POS) tags, entity subtype, entity class, entity role, semantic represen-tation of sentences and WordNet synonym set.
As we use a veryhigh dimensional and very sparse feature vector for relation extraction, it can beexpected that SVM will have similarly good performance.
Therefore we used the one-against-one method in the experiments(see Section 5.1 for more details).
Based on the previous works, we developed a set of features for semanticrelation extraction, many of which are adopted from [19].
Moreover, we intro-duce some new features such as POS tags, entity subtype and class features,entity mention role feature, and several general semantic features.
Therefore in our method, we introduce instead a set of more general semanticfeatures produced by a semantic analyser and WordNet.
