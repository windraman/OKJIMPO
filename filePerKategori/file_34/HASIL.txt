The results show there is a trade-off amongthese factors for relation extraction and the features containing moreinformation such as semantic ones can improve the performance of theontological relation extraction task.
The results show that performance on relation detection level is the highestwhile that on subtype classification is the lowest.
The performance for the type EMP-ORGwhen classifying on the type level is the best among all 7 relation types: 77.29%Precision, 75.00% Recall and 76.01% F1 averaged over 5 folds cross validation.
However, the performance on the 7 subtypes within EMP-ORG when classifyingat subtype level is not only much lower than the result for EMP-ORG overallbut also rather unstable: from zero for Partner to 72.79% for Subsidiary.
Thetwo biggest subtypes Employ-Exec and Employ-Staff get only 67.16% and 62.25% F1 which are much lower than the 76.01% on type level for their parent typeEMP-ORG.
But the improvement atvarious levels is different: as more features are used, the improvement in relationdetection is only 10.34% (from 61.25% to 71.59%), while the improvement intype and subtype classification is much more significant: 23.59% (from 41.61%to 65.20%) and 23.40% (from 33.38% to 56.78%).
