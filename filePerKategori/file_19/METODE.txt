Feature Selection and Feature Extract ion
 Text Categorization
If a syntactic parse of text is available, then features can be defined by the presence of two or more words in particular syntactic relationships. We call such a fea- ture a syntactic indexing phrase.
Syntactic phrase indexing and term clustering have op- posite effects on the properties of a text representation, which led us t o  investigate combining the two techniques [3].
We experimented with forming clusters from words under three metafeature definitions, and from phrases under eight metafeature definitions 141. 
We first looked a t  effectiveness of proportional assign- ment with word-based indexing languages
We checked for overfitting directly by testing the induced classifiers on the training set.
