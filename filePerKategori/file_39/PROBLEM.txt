An automatic measure of read-ability that incorporated both lexical and gram-matical features was thus needed.
One goal of this work is to show that the use of pedagogically motivated grammatical features (e.g., passive voice, rather than the number of words per sen-tence) can improve readability measures based on lexical features alone.
This phenome-non suggests that grammatical features may play a more important role in predicting and measuring L2 readability.
