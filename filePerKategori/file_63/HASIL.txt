In the experiments, our methodachieved 97% of manual translation case in terms of the average precision.
In terms of average precisions compared with NODIS, theproposed disambiguation method improved 1.0 point forNTCIR and 0.8 point for NEAR, but decreased 0.7 pointfor AND.
In this experiment, differences of the average precisionsamong four measures were lower than 0.1% and nosignificant difference was observed.
