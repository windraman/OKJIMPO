With the worldwide growth of the Internet, research on Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) isbeing paid much attention.
Existing CLIR approaches based on query translation require parallel corporaor comparable corpora for the disambiguation of translated query terms.
However, those naturallanguage resources are not readily available.
One of the major technical problems to be solved in CLIRconcerns the translation of short queries of one or fewwords, appropriately.
Possible translation-candidates mightbe numerous in such cases and resolving such ambiguitiesbecomes a hard task.
