In this paper, we propose a novel approach for CLIRsystem targeting Web documents, which uses a naturallanguage resource that is extracted from a Web searchengine as a corpus, and resolves the ambiguities caused bythe dictionary-based query translation approach, by using aco-occurrence information.
The obtainedtranslation-candidates are disambiguated, using term co-occurrence statistics and then passed to the search engine.
A query submitted by a user is first segmented into wordsusing a morphological analyzer.
Then, each word istranslated into the target language using a machine-readable dictionary.
For instance, thenumber of retrieved documents by searching some termscombined by AND operators, can be regarded as a co-occurrence frequency of those terms in a Web documentcorpus.
