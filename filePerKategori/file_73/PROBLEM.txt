However standard queries, containing 2-3 terms in average, are less and less likely to be sufficient to retrieve all of the relevant documents.  
Consequently, advanced techniques are necessary to enhance the performances of Information Retrieval (IR) systems, such as Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR).
Bridging the gap between document and query languages requires the application of machine translation techniques to queries, indices, or both.
Translation software can induce linguistic differences between translated data and human language.
