The backbone is an Information Retrieval (IR) system based on a search engine and a multilingual module based on statistical machine translation of documents.
To this system is added a Query Expansion (QE) module which mainly uses linguistic resources to perform the expansion.
Our proposal is to overcome this problem by using Query Expansion (QE).
QE consists in adding new words to the initial query.
In a nutshell, our key idea is to combine QE with CLIR in a Multilingual Multimedia Information Retrieval (MMIR) prototype.
