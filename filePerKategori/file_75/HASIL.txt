The results demonstrate unambigu-ously that the event and relation representationsoutperform the tf*idf representation, with stronglysignificant p-values less than 0.001 for both Rougemeasures and all summary lengths.
Results suggest thatthe entity pair model based on GRE data out-performs the entity pair model based on atomicevents, at least for medium sized summaries of100 and 200 words where ER is significantly betterthan EE for both Rouge measures.
The scores for the entitypair representations reported in Table 3 are statisti-cally indistinguishable from those for correspond-ing relation and event representations in Table 2above.
Performance for the re-lation representation is significantly better than anon-trivial tf*idf baseline across the range of sum-mary lengths explored.
Performance is also atleast as good as a comparable but less general rep-resentation based on event extraction.
Correlationanalysis suggests that different representations arecomplementary due to the fact that they performwell on different document sets.
