While our method outperforms the subtree kernels bothin precision and recall, the shortest path kernel only in precision.
Though theshortest path kernel has better recall, we note that our method is more generalthan the shortest path kernel, as it is not restricted to binary target relations.
Empirical results on a popularbenchmark dataset indicate that the performance of our method is comparablewith state-of-the-art methods.
