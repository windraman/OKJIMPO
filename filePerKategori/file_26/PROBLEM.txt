In recent years, text mining has moved far beyond the clas-sical problem of text classification with an increased interest in moresophisticated processing of large text corpora, such as, for example, eval-uations of complex queries.
Obviously, the internal representation of texts ina search index as sequences of words is insufficient to recover semantics fromunstructured text (e.g., the “born in” relation in the above example).
Relationextraction is one of the essential steps towards more complex automatic textprocessing.
It is concerned with the problem of detecting and classifying prede-fined semantic relations among m-tuples (typically between pairs) of entities inunstructured texts.
