The results for different thresholds of p(r|w) areshown in Figure 3. As can be seen, the MLE base-lines (in red with syntactic patterns and green withintertext) perform consistently worse than the mod-els learned using the topic models (in pink and blue).The difference in precision, aggregated across all re-lations, is statistically significant at 95% confidencefor most of the thresholds.
