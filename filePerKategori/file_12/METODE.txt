Similar to other distant supervision methods, our ap-proach takes as input an existing knowledge basecontaining entities and relations, and a textual cor-pus. In this work it is not necessary for the corpusto be related to the knowledge base. In what followswe assume that all the relations studied are binaryand hold between exactly two entities in the knowl-edge base. We also assume a dependency parser isavailable, and that the entities have been automat-ically disambiguated using the knowledge base assense inventory.
Two ways of extracting patterns havebeen used: (a) Syntactic, taking the dependencypath between the two entities, and (b) Intertext,taking the text between the two.
