Classification of data becomes difficult because of unbounded size and imbalance nature of data. Class imbalance problem become greatest issue in data mining
Imbalance problem occur where one of the two classes having more sample than other classes
There are different methods available for classification of imbalance data set which is divided into three main categories, the algorithmic approach, data-preprocessing approach and feature selection approach
 In imbalance data set the class having more number of instances is called as major class while the one having relatively less number of instances are called as minor class [16]
