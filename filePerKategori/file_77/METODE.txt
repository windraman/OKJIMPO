SVMs here are employed to produce a setof possible interpretations for domain relevant concepts.
The common ideaof these works is that the computation of the function f(as in Eq. 1) is translated into an automatic classificationstep.
SVM classifiers learn a decision boundary be-tween two data classes that maximizes the minimum dis-tance, or margin, of the training points of each class fromthe boundary.
