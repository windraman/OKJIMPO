In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach tolearning for Relation Detection, based on the use of massiveclustering ensembles.
In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible unsuper-vised approach to learning for Relation Detection, based onclustering, which reduces the elements of human supervisionand simplifies the use of enriched feature sets with respectto other existing approaches.
Our approach is based on the transformation of RelationDetection between entities of two given types, T1 and T2,into a binary classification problem: each pair of entitiesE1 and E2 of the proposed types co-occurring in thesame sentence has to be classified as related or unrelated.
To classify each pair, we use a two-step scoring-filteringarchitecture.
A scorer is used to calculate the score for thisinstance, s(x), and a filterer assigns it to the related orunrelated class according to whether this score is above orbelow a relatedness threshold, threl, respectively.
