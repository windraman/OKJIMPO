The results indicate thaton average, for K4, the best performing kernel, we obtainedan increase of 24.66% in the F-score when features providedby the semantic parsers were added. When relying on SDTs,the average Precision that was obtained was 89.3%, the re-call was 76.4%, thus an F-score of 82.35%, when using thesame data as [1]. 
The re-sults show that frame semantics produce an enhancement of53.24% over previous state-of-art results in relation extrac-tion. Furthermore, they show that semantic representationssuch as frames or predicate-argument structures have a widerimpact on classification performance than the classificationtechnique.
