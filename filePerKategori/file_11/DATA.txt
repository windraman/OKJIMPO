To evaluate the role of shallow semantics provided by se-mantic parsers on relation extraction we have used the Auto-matic Content Extraction (ACE) corpus available from LDC(LDC2003T11). The data consists of 422 annotated text doc-uments gathered from various newspapers and broadcasts.Five entity types have been annotated (PERSON, ORGANI-ZATION, GEO-POLITICAL ENTITY, LOCATION, FACILITY)along with the 24 types of relations.
