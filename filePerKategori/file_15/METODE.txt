 Based on the EM algorithm, we proposea new text clustering algorithm, named Text Clustering withFeature Selection (TCFS), which performs the clustering and thesupervised feature selection alternately until convergence.Recall that we de?ned the problem of text clustering as thegrouping of documents with similar topics into a cluster. As weuse the EM algorithm, we assume that each cluster of documentshas a Gaussian distribution of terms. That means, a corpus withk clusters is considered as a mixture of k Gaussian distributions.Given the parameters and our Gaussian model, we maximize thelikelihood of our data set. The maximum likelihood representshow well our Gaussian model ?ts the data set. In this case,the clustering criterion for the TCFS algorithm is the maximumlikelihood, and a natural criterion for the feature selection also isthe maximum likelihood.
