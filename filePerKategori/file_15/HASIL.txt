Our experimental results indicate that CHIR consistently out-performs other three methods in terms of increasing the cohe-siveness values of the clusters. The performance of CC and CHIare very close in some cases, which tells us that identifyingonly the positive term-category dependency is not suf?cient.The term-goodness measure should also describe the dependencyaccurately. SCHI does not perform well in most cases becausethe de?nition of s?2 (see Equation 9) does not contain suf?cientinformation about the ?2 term-category independence test.
