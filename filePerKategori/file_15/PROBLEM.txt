The problem of document clustering is generally de?ned asfollows: given a set of documents, we would like to partitionthem into a predetermined or an automatically derived numberof clusters, such that the documents assigned to each clusterare more similar to each other than the documents assigned todifferent clusters. 
In this research, we extended the ?2 term-category indepen-dence test by introducing new statistical data that can measurewhether the dependency between a term and a category is positiveor negative. This new statistical data can describe the term-category dependency more accurately than the two variants ofDigital Object Indentifier 10.1109/TKDE.2007.190740 1041-4347/$25.00 ©  2007 IEEEthe ?2 statistic — correlation coef?cient and GSS coef?cient.We also developed a new supervised feature selection method,named CHIR, which is based on the ?2 statistic and the new term-category dependency measure.
