From the extracted relations, the system built 306 clus-ters of two or more instances, which were manuallyevaluated by two authors of this paper.
81 of our clus-ters contain two or more instances of exactly the samerelation, mostly due to the same sentence appearingin several documents of the corpus.
Of the remaining225 clusters, 121 were marked as consistent (i.e., all in-stances in the cluster express a similar relation), 35 aspartly consistent (i.e., more than half of the instancesin the cluster express a similar relation), 69 as not use-ful.
Of our 121 consistent clusters, 76 were classified as be-ing of the type ’same pattern’, 27 as being of the type’same topic’ and 18 as being of the type ’relation para-phrases’.
For the same sentences, the IDEX system extracted 27relations, 11 of them corresponding to the manuallyextracted ones.
This yields a recall value of 73% anda precision value of 41%.
