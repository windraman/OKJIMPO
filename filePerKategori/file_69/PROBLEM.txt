Translation dictionaries do not exist for every languagepair, and they are usually trained on large parallel corpora, where each document hasan exact translation in the other language, or are hand-built.
Parallel corpora are notavailable for each language pair.
In contrast, comparable corpora in which documentsin the source and the target language contain similar content, are usually available inabundance.
In this paper we address the question whether suitable cross-language re-trieval models can be built based on the interlingual topic representations learned fromcomparable corpora.
