As the corresponding figures show, the LDA-only model seems to be toocoarse to be used as the only component of an IR model (e.g., due to its limited numberof topics, words in queries unobserved during training).
However, the combination ofthe LDA-only and the simple unigram model, which allows retrieving relevant docu-ments based on shared words across the languages (e.g. personal names), leads to muchbetter scores which are competitive even with models which utilize cross-lingual dic-tionaries or machine translation systems.
For instance, our LDA-unigram model wouldhave been placed among the top 5 retrieval systems for the CLEF 2002 Bilingual toDutch task, would have been placed among the top 3 retrieval systems for the CLEF2001 Bilingual to Dutch task, and outperforms the only participating system in theCLEF 2002 Dutch to English task (MAP: 0.1495) [20, 21].
We have thoroughly evaluated this cross-language retrieval model using standardtest collections from the CLEF 2001-2003 CLIR campaigns and have shown that ourcombined model, which fuses evidence from the BiLDA model and the unigram model,is competitive with the current top CLIR systems that use translation resources that arehand-built or are trained on parallel corpora.
