Multi-document summarization differs from single in that the issues of compression, speed, redundancy and passage selec- tion are critical in the formation of useful summaries.
However, large- scale IR and summarization have not yet been truly in- tegrated, and the functionality challenges on a summa- rization system are greater in a true IR or topic-detection context (Yang et al., 1998; Allan et al., 1998).
Ideally, multi-document summaries should contain the key shared relevant infor- mation among all the documents only once, plus other information unique to some of the individual documents that are directly relevant to the user's query. 
The degree of redundancy in information contained within a group of topically-related articles is much higher than the degree of redundancy within an arti- cle, as each article is apt to describe the main point as well as necessary shared background.
A group of articles may contain a temporal dimen- sion, typical in a stream of news reports about an unfolding event.
The compression ratio (i.e. the size of the summary with respect o the size of the document set) will typically be much smaller for collections of dozens or hundreds of topically related documents than for single document summaries.
The co-reference problem in summarization presents even greater challenges for multi- document han for single-document summariza- tion (Baldwin and Morton, 1998).
