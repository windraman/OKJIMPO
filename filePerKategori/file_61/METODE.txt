To get all possible English senses for every Japanese term, the online dictionary SPACEALC is utilized.
The EWC semantic relatedness measure is used to select the most related meanings for the results of translation.
This measure combines the Wikipedia-based Explicit Semantic Analysis measure, the WordNet path measure and the mixed collocation index.
We assume that terms in any query should be semantically related to each other.
After segmenting the queries, we obtain full sets of translations for each Japanese term.
The final step is to select the most semantically related alternatives applying EWC.
