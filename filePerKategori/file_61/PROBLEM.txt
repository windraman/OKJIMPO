Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) can be used to retrieve documents in one language in response to a query given in another.
The usual approach consists of two steps: 1) translation of the user query into the target language and then 2) retrieval of documents in this language by using a conventional mono-lingual information retrieval system.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to translate queries for a Japanese-English CLIR task.
