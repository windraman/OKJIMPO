The experimental results on data sets from both topic-based and sentiment classification tasks show that this new method is robust across different tasks and numbers of selected features. 
we can see that the MI score is based on the second basic measurement. This method assumes that the term with higher category ratio is more effective for classification
we can say that the IG score is influenced by the two basic measurements. 
we see that the CHI score is related to both the frequency measurement iA
 and ratio measurement /i iA B
 we can easily draw the two following conclusions: 1) Given the same value of iA , the BNS score increases with the increase of i iA B? . 2) Given the same value of i iA B? , BNS score increase with the decrease of iA . 
In summary, the BNS FS method is biased towards the terms with the high category ratio but cannot be said to be sensitive to document frequency.
