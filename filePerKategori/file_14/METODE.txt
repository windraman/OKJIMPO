In this paper, an effective and efficient new method called variance-mean based feature filtering method of feature selection to do feature reduction in the representation phase for text classification is proposed. It keeps the best features, and thus improves the final performance e.g. macro-f1 to 0.92 and simultaneously decreases the computing time for representing the incoming text waiting to be classified dramatically, which is important because it occurs on line and is time-critical.
