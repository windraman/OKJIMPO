Compared with the classical document frequency incorporated feature filtering methods analyzed in section 4, such as DF, CHI used in our experiment, it shows in Figure 1, that our method can gain higher performance at a very low dimension, and quickly reach a peak, which means much less computing time and almost best performance while the other two classical methods and the like only show a slow ascend tendency from a lower performance evaluation value without a peak until the dimension reaches to almost the original one, which means decreasing the dimension dramatically without great loss of performance is hard to realize.
