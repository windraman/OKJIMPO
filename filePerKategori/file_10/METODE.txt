Our basic methodology for section segmentation is to clas-sify each line in a document to indicate its membership to asection. Our classifier operates at the line-level rather thanthe sentence-level, as content of clinical records tends tobe fragmentary and list-based. Similar to Hirohata et al.(2008), we relied on BIO tags to differentiate the begin-nings of sections (which tend to consist of headers) fromthe remaining lines.Under this methodology we tried two approaches: a joint(one-step) approach and a pipeline (two-step) approach.Both approaches are described below.
