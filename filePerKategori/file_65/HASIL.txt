The experimental result shows that our proposed method brings significant improvement in retrieval accuracy for English document collections, but deficient for Malay document collections.
As shown in Table 4, the English document MAP results for IR2 were 2.1 and 5.1% lower than mono IR1 result and the Malay document MAP results for IR2 were 3.4 and 7.5% lower than mono IR1 result, as expected.
The English document MAP result for IR3 is higher than IR2 by 2 and 0.6% and the Malay document MAP result for IR3 is lower than IR2 by 2.5 and 2.8%, respectively.
As can be seen in this figure, dictionary-based CLIR approach in IR2, showed decreasing in retrieval performance compared to Mono IR system in IR1.
As shown in Table 4, the MAP results for using first translation were 3% and 4.1% higher than using all translation candidates result for English and Malay document collections.
Translation approach in IR2 and IR3, showed that CLIR query translation using first translation listed in the dictionary is obtained a better result compared to using all translation candidates listed in the dictionary either in English or Malay document collections.
