In this paper, an effective and efficient new method called variance-mean based feature filtering method of feature selection to do feature reduction in the representation phase for text classification is proposed.
And here we use the term frequency as the weight for the feature in a text’s feature vector for further constructing our evaluation function just because of convenience.
We then compute the mean and variance of the values for each row,
Thirdly, we compute the variance of the components’ data in vector 1), denoted as , which shows the degree of dispersion among classes the term w can demonstrate and the mean of the components’ data in vector 2), denoted as , which shows the average level of the degree of variability within every class the term w can show.
So and based criterion can be used to evaluate the importance of the candidate term w.
The features whose  values are bigger than a threshold got by experiment are filtered.
