As more and more information is available in the Electronic
Health Record in the form of free-text narrative, there is a
need for automated tools, which can process and understand
such texts

 Our method re-
lies on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained on a corpus
of 9,679 clinical notes from NewYork-Presbyterian Hospi-
tal.

This paper focuses on the discourse-level analysis of clin-
ical notes, namely argumentative zoning [19].

Our work contrasts from their approach in the fol-
lowing ways: (i) sections are classi?ed as part of a sequence,
not independently of the other sections in the note; (ii) our
set of section labels is more generic than theirs, and thus
smaller, so as to be robust across note types (e.g., discharge
summaries vs. outpatient consult notes); and (iii) like in
their work, our dataset is comprised of sections with head-
ers mapped to the 15 section labels automatically according
to a hand-built mapping dictionary.

In this section we present our algorithm for assigning one
of 15 section types.

We hypothesize that section sequences can improve the
accuracy of section label classi?cation.

In our dataset of 9,679 notes we paid attention to the
following: we did not include notes with less than two section
headers; we did not include notes in the training data, which
came from the same patient id as the clinical notes present
in the test set.
Label: OTHER  StartNode: 21094  EndNode: 21227
This way, we avoid boosting the accuracy
of our classi?er arti?cially due to repetition of content in
the notes for the same patient.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 21629  EndNode: 21709
The test set contains 2,088 clinical notes,
corresponding to 11,706 text spans. 
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 26734  EndNode: 26986
Finally, we have assumed that text span boundaries in
clinical notes are known, which is unusual in practice. In
order to improve the accuracy of the classi?er, a future di-
rection for this study is to segment and classify text spans
at the same time.
