Dimensionality reduction techniques have become
a required step when working with bioinformatics datasets.

This paper presents seven univariate feature
selection techniques and collects them into a single family
entitled First Order Statistics (FOS) based feature selection.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 1682  EndNode: 1833
Our results show that in general, each
feature selection technique will create diverse feature subsets
when compared to the other members of the family

In addition to the
seven techniques we use eleven DNA microarray datasets
from various medical, genetics, and bioinformatics studies;
twelve feature subset sizes; and three learners.

The datasets are all DNA
microarray datasets acquired from a number of different real
world bioinformatics, genetics, and medical projects. Since
the FOS techniques require only two classes to be present,
we have to use datasets with two classes (for example:
cancerous/non-cancerous or relapse/no relapse).

 In this paper we present
seven univariate feature selection techniques (Fold Change
Difference, Fold Change Ratio, Welch T Statistic, Wilcoxon
Rank Sum, Fisher Score, SAM, and Signal-to-Noise) as a
single new family which we name First Order Statistics
(FOS) based feature selection, due to their use of ï¬?rst
order statistical measurements such as mean and standard
deviation.

In terms of similarity, we ï¬?nd that each ranker in the
FOS family of techniques will create diverse feature subsets
when compared to other members of the family. The only
exception for this is Fold Change Difference and SAM
which consistently achieve above 0.7 similarity score for
155
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 31387  EndNode: 31762
In terms of classiï¬?cation, we can see that despite the
diversity of the feature subsets, the classiï¬?cation results
of the rankers are quite similar with one exception: Fold
Change Ratio. Fold Change Ratio achieves much different
results than the other members of the family and is found
to be the worst ranker of the set of FOS rankers in terms
of classiï¬?cation results
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 31898  EndNode: 32029
As for the top
performers, we ï¬?nd that SAM followed by Signal-to-Noise
are commonly the top performers within all three learners.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32041  EndNode: 32213
we recommend SAM and S2N for classiï¬?cation
results. However, the entire FOS set of feature rankers (with
the exception of Fold Change Ratio) are comparable to each
other.
