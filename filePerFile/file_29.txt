Modern models of relation extraction for tasks like
ACE are based on supervised learning of relations
from small hand-labeled corpora.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 349  EndNode: 528
We investigate an
alternative paradigm that does not require labeled
corpora, avoiding the domain dependence of ACE-
style algorithms, and allowing the use of corpora
of any size.

hms, and allowing the use of corpora
of any size. Our experiments use Freebase, a large
semantic database of several thousand relations, to
provide distant supervision.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 648  EndNode: 854
For each pair of enti-
ties that appears in some Freebase relation, we find
all sentences containing those entities in a large un-
labeled corpus and extract textual features to train
a relation classifier.

Our
model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 re-
lations at a precision of 67.6%.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 1167  EndNode: 1341
We also analyze
feature performance, showing that syntactic parse
features are particularly helpful for relations that are
ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2407  EndNode: 2482
Labeled training
data is expensive to produce and thus limited in
quantity.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2483  EndNode: 2615
Also, because the relations are labeled
on a particular corpus, the resulting classifiers tend
to be biased toward that text domain.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2879  EndNode: 3089
 Unsupervised approaches can
use very large amounts of data and extract very
large numbers of relations, but the resulting rela-
tions may not be easy to map to relations needed
for a particular knowledge base.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 3590  EndNode: 3664
The resulting patterns often suffer
from low precision and semantic drift.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 3665  EndNode: 3789
We propose an alternative paradigm, distant su-
pervision, that combines some of the advantages
of each of these approaches.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 12419  EndNode: 12584
The intuition of our distant supervision approach
is to use Freebase to give us a training set of rela-
tions and entity pairs that participate in those rela-
tions.

For unstructured text we use the Freebase
Wikipedia Extraction, a dump of the full text of all
Wikipedia articles (not including discussion and
Label: DATA  StartNode: 22835  EndNode: 22951
user pages) which has been sentence-tokenized by
Metaweb Technologies, the developers of Free-
base (Metaweb, 2008).

At most recall levels, the combination of syn-
tactic and lexical features offers a substantial im-
provement in precision over either of these feature
sets on its own.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 29936  EndNode: 30142
At a recall of 100 instances, the combination of
lexical and syntactic features has the best perfor-
mance for a majority of the relations, while at a re-
call level of 1000 instances the results are mixed.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 30234  EndNode: 30378
Our results show that the distant supervision algo-
rithm is able to extract high-precision patterns for
a reasonably large number of relations.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 31791  EndNode: 32101
Our results thus suggest that syntactic features
are indeed useful in distantly supervised informa-
tion extraction, and that the benefit of syntax oc-
curs in cases where the individual patterns are par-
ticularly ambiguous, and where they are nearby in
the dependency structure but distant in terms of
words.
