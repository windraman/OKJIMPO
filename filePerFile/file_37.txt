However, when 
dealing with a new task, it is still difficult to 
quickly select a suitable one from various FS 
methods provided by many previous studies.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 847  EndNode: 989
In this paper, we propose a theoretic 
framework of FS methods based on two basic 
measurements: frequency measurement and 
ratio measurement.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1066  EndNode: 1249
Moreover, with the guidance of 
our theoretical analysis, we propose a novel 
method called weighed frequency and odds 
(WFO) that combines the two measurements 
with trained weights.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2310  EndNode: 2441
However, comparing these FS methods 
appears to be difficult because they are usually 
based on different theories or measurements.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2783  EndNode: 2932
In order to better 
understand the relationship between these 
methods, building a general theoretical 
framework provides a fascinating perspective.

The first measurement is to compute the 
document frequency in one category, i.e., iA .
Label: METODE  StartNode: 10052  EndNode: 10180
The second measurement is the ratio between 
the document frequencies in one category and 
the other categories, i.e., /i iA B .
Label: METODE  StartNode: 10279  EndNode: 10398
These two measurements form the basis for all 
the measurements that are used by the FS 
methods throughout this paper.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 20041  EndNode: 20121
Therefore, we propose a new FS 
method called Weighed Frequency and Odds 
(WFO),

In topic-based text classification, we 
use two popular data sets: one subset of 
Reuters-21578 referred to as R2 and the 20 
Newsgroup dataset referred to as 20NG.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 21386  EndNode: 21601
In sentiment text 
classification, we also use two data sets: one is 
the widely used Cornell movie-review dataset2 
(Pang and Lee, 2004) and one dataset from 
product reviews of domain DVD3 (Blitzer et al., 
2007).
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 27762  EndNode: 27958
In the first case when the feature number is 
low (about less than 1,000), the FS methods in 
the second group including IG, CHI, WLLR,  
always perform better than those in the other two 
groups.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 28254  EndNode: 28489
In the second case when the feature number is 
large, among the six traditional methods, MI and 
BNS take the leads in the domains of 20NG and 
Movie while IG and CHI seem to be better and 
more stable than others in the domain of DVD.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 28491  EndNode: 28596
As for WFO, its performances are excellent cross 
all these three domains and different feature 
numbers.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 30359  EndNode: 30474
The 
experimental results show that our framework 
helps us to better understand and compare 
different FS methods.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 30475  EndNode: 30609
Furthermore, the novel 
method WFO generated from the framework, can 
perform robustly across different domains and 
feature numbers.
