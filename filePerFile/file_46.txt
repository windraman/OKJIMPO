Multi-document 
summarization differs from single in that the issues 
of compression, speed, redundancy and passage selec- 
tion are critical in the formation of useful summaries.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 793  EndNode: 1129
Our approach addresses these issues by using domain- 
independent techniques based mainly on fast, statistical 
processing, a metric for reducing redundancy and maxi- 
mizing diversity in the selected passages, and a modular 
framework to allow easy parameterization for different 
genres, corpora characteristics and user requirements.

However, large- 
scale IR and summarization have not yet been truly in- 
tegrated, and the functionality challenges on a summa- 
rization system are greater in a true IR or topic-detection 
context (Yang et al., 1998; Allan et al., 1998).
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 3149  EndNode: 3389
Ideally, multi-document 
summaries should contain the key shared relevant infor- 
mation among all the documents only once, plus other 
information unique to some of the individual documents 
that are directly relevant to the user's query. 
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 3573  EndNode: 3827
The degree of redundancy in information contained 
within a group of topically-related articles is much 
higher than the degree of redundancy within an arti- 
cle, as each article is apt to describe the main point 
as well as necessary shared background.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 3881  EndNode: 4000
A group of articles may contain a temporal dimen- 
sion, typical in a stream of news reports about an 
unfolding event.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 4091  EndNode: 4327
The compression ratio (i.e. the size of the summary 
with respect o the size of the document set) will 
typically be much smaller for collections of dozens 
or hundreds of topically related documents than 
for single document summaries.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 4617  EndNode: 4782
The co-reference problem in summarization 
presents even greater challenges for multi- 
document han for single-document summariza- 
tion (Baldwin and Morton, 1998).

This section discusses our current implementation of
a multi-document summarization system which is de- 
signed to produce summaries that emphasize "relevant 
novelty."
Label: METODE  StartNode: 16496  EndNode: 16648
A first approximation tomeasuring relevant novelty is to 
measure relevance and novelty independently and pro- 
vide a linear combination as the metric.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 16892  EndNode: 17080
Using this 
metric one can maximize marginal relevance in retrieval 
and summarization, hence we label our method "maxi- 
mal marginal relevance" (MMR) (Carboneli and Gold- 
stein, 1998). 
Label: DATA  StartNode: 21098  EndNode: 21161
We used the TIPSTER provided topic de- 
scription as the query.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 27305  EndNode: 27472
Counting clearly distinct propositions in both cases, 
yields a 60% greater information content for the MMR- 
MD case, though both summaries are equivalent in 
length.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 27474  EndNode: 27695
When these 200 documents were added to a set of 4 
other topics of 200 documents, yielding a document-set 
with 1000 documents, the query relevant multi-document 
summarization system produced exactly the same re- 
suits.
