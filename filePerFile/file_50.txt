The approach uses lexical analyses based
on tf.idf, an information retrieval measurement, to de-
termine the extent of the tiles, incorporating thesaural
informationvia a statisticaldisambiguation algorithm.

The tiles have been found to correspondwell to human
judgements of themajor subtopicboundaries of science
magazine articles.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 783  EndNode: 981
Expository texts such as science magazine articles and
environmental impact reports can be viewed as being
composed of a few main topics and a series of short,
sometimesdensely discussed, subtopics.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1446  EndNode: 1667
The capability to automate the recognition of this kind
of structure in a full-text document shouldbe useful for
improving a variety of computational tasks, e.g., hy-
pertext, text summarization and information retrieval.

Unlike standard discourse analysis approaches, Text-
Tiling breaks the text into simple, contiguous ‘tiles’ that
are meant to reflect only topical loci, and not the inter-
relations among the topics.

The algorithm is a two step process; first, all pairs of
adjacent blocks of text (where blocks are usually 3-5
sentences long) are compared and assigned a similar-
ity value, and then the resulting sequence of similarity
values, afterbeinggraphedandsmoothed, is examined
for peaks and valleys.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 8762  EndNode: 8935
 In TextTiling, each block of k sentences is
treated as a unit unto itself, and the frequency of a
term within each block is compared to its frequency
in the entire document
Label: METODE  StartNode: 9719  EndNode: 9921
Thus if the similarity score between two blocks is high,
then not only do the blocks have terms in common, but
the terms they have in common are relatively rare with
respect to the rest of the document.

The straightforward way to use the similarity infor-
mation is to plot, for each sentence gap, the similarity
value measured there.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 10710  EndNode: 10860
This re-
sult is plotted and for the sentence gap numbers where
no measurement was made, their values are filled in
by piecewise linear interpolation.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 10951  EndNode: 11110
We then compute the average similar-
ity value at each sentence gap number, giving equal
weight to input from each of the k measurements that
cross that point.

Lacking a standard test set, 5 the algorithm was eval-
uated on two data sources: three expository articles
(length 77 to 160 sentences), and the five short gen-
eral interest articles from (Morris 1988) (length 23 to 44
sentences).

The structure it obtains is coarse-grained but generally
reflects human judgement data.
