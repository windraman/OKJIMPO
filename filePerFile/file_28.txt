This paper proposes a novel method that extracts semantic
relations from social data in order to acquire ontologies that are used
for mining social data.

A set of nouns are iteratively extracted from
documents in a bootstrapping manner, and then a semantic relation
between a noun pair is identified by a clustering procedure.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 575  EndNode: 753
The main
feature is exploitation of the co-occurrence of a verb and a noun in a
sentence, considering that a verb plays an important role in expressing
the meaning of a sentence.

Since semantic technologies
have yet to catch up with the explosive growth in the publishing of data on the
Social Web, mining the social data is still a challenging issue.

This paper addresses the issue of semantic relation extraction from doc-
uments on the Social Web.

Prompted by this observation, the method identifies nouns appear-
ing together with particular verbs at a high frequency.

This is a hybrid method
involving a bootstrapping procedure and a clustering procedure.

The bootstrap-
ping procedure is a process that initially extracts patterns from given verb-noun
pairs and then alternately extracts pairs and patterns.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 3525  EndNode: 3699
The clustering procedure identifies weak se-
mantic relations for each pair of nouns obtained by the bootstrapping procedure,
resulting in the hierarchical form of the nouns.

The method consists of two procedures: bootstrapping and clustering.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 7914  EndNode: 8001
The
bootstrapping procedure consists of pattern acquisition and term acquisition
steps.

We apply the proposed method to a set of three hundred Web documents, which
are blog posts mentioned on food products.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 10711  EndNode: 10864
Indeed, as
shown in Table 1, precision value is 0.806 in case that the number of seed pairs
is 10, and it is within a range of 0.2 to 0.4 in other cases.

On the other hand, a
number of false negative pairs resulted in low recall.
