This work evaluates a system that uses in-
terpolated predictions of reading difficulty 
that are based on both vocabulary and 
grammatical features.

The REAP tutoring system (Heilman, et al. 2006), 
aims to provide authentic reading materials of the 
appropriate difficulty level, in terms of both vo-
cabulary and grammar, for English as a Second 
Language students

The statistical model used for this study is 
based on a variation of the multinomial Na√Øve 
Bayes classifier.

The language models employed in this work are 
simple: they are based on unigrams and assume 
that the probability of a token is independent of the 
surrounding tokens

Two corpora of labeled texts were used in the 
evaluation
Label: DATA  StartNode: 20745  EndNode: 20869
  The first corpus was from a set of texts 
gathered from the Web for a prior evaluation of the 
language modeling approach.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 21074  EndNode: 21387
The second corpora consisted of textbook mate-
rials (Adelson-Goldstein and Howard, 2004, for 
level 2; Ediger and Pavlik, 2000, for levels 3 and 4; 
Silberstein, 2002, for level 5) from a series of Eng-
lish as a Second Language reading courses at the 
English Language Institute at the University of 
Pittsburgh

The results of this work suggest that grammatical 
features can play a role in predicting reading diffi-
culty levels for both first and second language texts 
in English.
