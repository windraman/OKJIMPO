We extend previous work on tree kernels
to estimate the similarity between the
dependency trees of sentences.

 Using
this kernel within a Support Vector Ma-
chine, we detect and classify relations
between entities in the Automatic Con-
tent Extraction (ACE) corpus of news
articles.

We examine the utility of dif-
ferent features such as Wordnet hyper-
nyms, parts of speech, and entity types,
and find that the dependency tree kernel
achieves a 20% F1 improvement over a
“bag-of-words” kernel.

The ability to detect complex patterns in data is
limited by the complexity of the data’s represen-
tation.

We describe a relation extraction technique
based on kernel methods.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 2418  EndNode: 2603
Kernel methods are
non-parametric density estimation techniques that
compute a kernel function between data instances,
where a kernel function can be thought of as a
similarity measure.

To address this problem, we apply SVMs
to the task of relation exraction.

We define a tree kernel over dependency trees
and incorporate this kernel within an SVM to ex-
tract relations from newswire documents.

We extract relations from the Automatic Con-
tent Extraction (ACE) corpus provided by the
National Institute for Standards and Technol-
ogy (NIST).

The first result of interest is that the sparse tree
kernel does not perform as well as the con-
tiguous tree kernel.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 22194  EndNode: 22436
The second result of interest is that all tree
kernels outperform the bag-of-words kernel,
most noticeably in recall performance, implying
that the structural information the tree kernel pro-
vides is extremely useful for relation extraction.

We have shown that using a dependency tree ker-
nel for relation extraction provides a vast improve-
ment over a bag-of-words kernel.

While the de-
pendency tree kernel appears to perform well at
the task of classifying relations, recall is still rela-
tively low.
