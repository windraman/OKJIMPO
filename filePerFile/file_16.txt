With the advent of new technologies large amount of 
data with a high number of attributes can be collected 
automatically.

When we have an empirical knowledge about the classes 
assigned to the samples in the training set, we say that the 
learning problem has a supervised nature. If the samples are 
not labeled, the learning problem is considered as 
unsupervised. In many application problems there is 
available a significant amount of unlabelled data, and only 
few labeled samples. The introduction of such few labels can 
improve the classification accuracy significantly [17]. We 
will refer to this problem as semi-supervised learning and it 
has recently received an increased interest in the pattern 
recognition and machine learning communities.

In this paper, a filter method for feature selection is 
presented. A new hybrid method for semi-supervised 
problem is proposed, which combines supervised and 
unsupervised measures of information. This approach applies 
a strategy to obtain a feature subset through clustering 
techniques.

We focus on the application problems where the 
unlabeled information can improve in a significant way the 
classification result of just using the limited labeled samples 
available.

For the experimentation the following datasets have been 
chosen of the UCI repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). 
• Gisette is a big data in the UCI repository, with 5000 
attributes and 13500 objects, 7000 of them labelled. 
It is a handwritten digit recognition problem; and the 
task is to discriminate between the four and the nine 
numbers. It has artificial attributes that are randomly 
generated, and the values are rather sparse, about 
13% of the values are non-zero. In the experiments, 
only the first 500 features with the highest entropy 
were used. 
• Optdigits problem is about the recognition of a 
handwritten number. The database has 5620 samples 
and 64 features. The 32x32 bitmaps are divided into 
no overlapping blocks of 4x4 and the number of 
pixels is counted in each block. This generates an 
input matrix of 8x8 (64 features) where each value is 
an integer in the range 0..16.  
• In covtype database, the objective is predicting forest 
cover type from cartographic variables, with no 
remotely sensed data. This database has 54 features, 
581012 objects and 7 classes. 
A hyperspectral image called 92AV3C [9] has also been 
used, corresponding to a spectral image (145 x 145 pixels, 
220 bands, and 17 classes) acquired with the AVIRIS, in 
June 1992, over the Indian Pine Test, in Northwestern 
Indiana. (http:/dynamo.ecn.purdue.edu/?biehl/MultiSpec) It 
has also pixels with an undetermined class. In this 
hyperspectral image several bands are discarded due to the 
effect of atmospheric absorption; 185 of the original 220 
bands were used discarding the lowest signal-to-noise ratio 
bands.

 In these 
cases, the unsupervised information improves the accuracy 
and the ssfc method is adequate (see gisette in figure 1). 
Optdigits is a database where sup technique gets high-
quality features for few labeled samples. Thus, in this case 
the ssfc has similar performance than sup. Nevertheless when 
the number of labeled samples is increased, ssfc and sup 
become similar to supT.
