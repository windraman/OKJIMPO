The recognition and storage of complex re-
lations among subjects mentioned in these sources is a very
difficult and time consuming task, ultimately based on pools
of experts.

SVMs here are employed to produce a set
of possible interpretations for domain relevant concepts.

The empirical investigation pre-
sented here shows that accurate results, comparable to the
expert teams, can be achieved, and parametrization allows
to fine tune the system behavior for fitting the specific do-
main requirements.

Hence text mining techniques based
on pure linguistic strategies fail to extract information from
texts.

The common idea
of these works is that the computation of the function f
(as in Eq. 1) is translated into an automatic classification
step.

SVM classifiers learn a decision boundary be-
tween two data classes that maximizes the minimum dis-
tance, or margin, of the training points of each class from
the boundary.

The experimental corpus, made of 86 documents, annotated
by two teams of analysts, has been extracted from two collec-
tions of public judicial acts related to the legal proceedings
against the same large criminal enterprise.

Although the precision score of Decision Tree
and NaiveBayes are better than the model trained over the
bag-of-words (i.e. a simple model), it achieves an overall
lower F1 measure (0.31 and 0.4 vs. 0.45) this is due to the
higher generalisation power of the kernel methods, in fact
the simple Bow model is already able to achieve an higher
recall level.

On some more complex relationship
classes, as PP knows PP and PP hangs out at a Pl, the
KXBOW kernel achieves lower performances, basically due
to the presence of dialectal or syntactically odd expressions.

As apparent, the plot shows a regular shape and it
suggests that parameter tuning can be effectively applied to
capture the required trade-off between the suitable coverage
and the required accuracy of the method.

The technology designed and tested in the project has been
