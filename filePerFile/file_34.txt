Automatic extraction of semantic relationships between en-
tity instances in an ontology is useful for attaching richer semantic meta-
data to documents.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 572  EndNode: 759
In this paper we propose an SVM based approach
to hierarchical relation extraction, using features derived automatically
from a number of GATE-based open-source language processing tools.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 760  EndNode: 960
In comparison to the previous works, we use several new features includ-
ing part of speech tag, entity subtype, entity class, entity role, semantic
representation of sentence and WordNet synonym set.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 1085  EndNode: 1306
The results show there is a trade-off among
these factors for relation extraction and the features containing more
information such as semantic ones can improve the performance of the
ontological relation extraction task.

However, in addition to this,
many ontology-based applications require methods for automatic discovery of
properties and relations between instances.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2279  EndNode: 2418
One barrier to applying relation extraction in ontology-based applications
comes from the difficulty of adapting the system to new domains.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 3838  EndNode: 4000
Motivated by the above work, we use the SVM as well and apply a diverse
set of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to derive features for relation
extraction.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 4000  EndNode: 4195
 In particular, several new features are introduced, such as part-of-
speech (POS) tags, entity subtype, entity class, entity role, semantic represen-
tation of sentences and WordNet synonym set.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 5491  EndNode: 5646
As we use a very
high dimensional and very sparse feature vector for relation extraction, it can be
expected that SVM will have similarly good performance.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 9555  EndNode: 9654
Therefore we used the one-against-one method in the experiments
(see Section 5.1 for more details).
Label: METODE  StartNode: 11443  EndNode: 11573
Based on the previous works, we developed a set of features for semantic
relation extraction, many of which are adopted from [19].
Label: METODE  StartNode: 11574  EndNode: 11737
Moreover, we intro-
duce some new features such as POS tags, entity subtype and class features,
entity mention role feature, and several general semantic features.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 12078  EndNode: 12208
Therefore in our method, we introduce instead a set of more general semantic
features produced by a semantic analyser and WordNet.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 23169  EndNode: 23277
We evaluate our method, especially the contribution of the different features, on
the ACE2004 training data.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32151  EndNode: 32279
The results show that performance on relation detection level is the highest
while that on subtype classification is the lowest.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32668  EndNode: 32865
The performance for the type EMP-ORG
when classifying on the type level is the best among all 7 relation types: 77.29%
Precision, 75.00% Recall and 76.01% F1 averaged over 5 folds cross validation.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32866  EndNode: 33090
However, the performance on the 7 subtypes within EMP-ORG when classifying
at subtype level is not only much lower than the result for EMP-ORG overall
but also rather unstable: from zero for Partner to 72.79% for Subsidiary.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 33091  EndNode: 33257
The
two biggest subtypes Employ-Exec and Employ-Staff get only 67.16% and 62.25
% F1 which are much lower than the 76.01% on type level for their parent type
EMP-ORG.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 34144  EndNode: 34450
But the improvement at
various levels is different: as more features are used, the improvement in relation
detection is only 10.34% (from 61.25% to 71.59%), while the improvement in
type and subtype classification is much more significant: 23.59% (from 41.61%
to 65.20%) and 23.40% (from 33.38% to 56.78%).
