Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 237  EndNode: 336
Our goal is to automatically detect boundaries between discussions
of different topics in meetings.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 337  EndNode: 419
Towards this end we adapt the
TextTiling algorithm [1] to the context of meetings.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 420  EndNode: 579
Our features
include not only the overlapped words between adjacent windows,
but also overlaps in the amount of speech contributed by each
meeting participant.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 726  EndNode: 818
We report average precision of
0.85 and recall of 0.59 when segmenting unseen test meetings.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 819  EndNode: 1035
Er-
ror analysis of our results shows that although the basic idea of our
algorithm is sound, it breaks down when participants stray from
typical behavior (such as when they monopolize the conversation
for too long).

Our goal as a part of the CALO project1 is to automatically un-
derstand discussions at meetings.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1252  EndNode: 1332
A first step towards such under-
standing is to detect the topics of discussion.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1333  EndNode: 1454
This problem can be
broken into two parts – detecting when there is a change of topic,
and determining what the topic is.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1455  EndNode: 1601
In this paper we describe our
current work on the first question – the detection of boundaries
between different topics of discussion in meetings.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 2011  EndNode: 2248
We base our algorithm on Marti Hearst’s TextTiling
[1] algorithm where the probability that a point in a text essay is
a topic boundary is computed based on the similarity between the
words in windows to the left and right of that point.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 14147  EndNode: 14242
The data we use in this paper consists of 3 sequences of meetings
named CMU-2, CMU-3 and SRI-1.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 17581  EndNode: 17743
On performing this experiment across all the 6 data combi-
nations, we get an average precision of 0.85, recall of 0.59 and
f–measure of 0.67 on unseen test data.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 18012  EndNode: 18208
The exact “best”
window size for the two predictors changes based on the training
data; the average being 56 seconds for the speech activity predic-
tor and 70 seconds for the all words predictor.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 18209  EndNode: 18346
The average best
weight for linear combination is 0.6 for the speech activity bound-
ary predictor (and 0.4 for the all words predictor).
