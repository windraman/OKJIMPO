Cross-language information retrieval today is dominated by techniques that rely principally on
context-independent token-to-token mappings despite the fact that state-of-the-art statistical
machine translation systems now have far richer translation models available in their
internal representations.

This paper explores combination-of-evidence techniques using
three types of statistical translation models: context-independent token translation, token
translation using phrase-dependent contexts, and token translation using sentence-dependent
contexts.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1040  EndNode: 1335
Context-independent translation is performed using statistically-aligned tokens in
parallel text, phrase-dependent translation is performed using aligned statistical phrases, and
sentence-dependent translation is performed using those same aligned phrases together with an
n-gram language model.

Experiments on retrieval of Arabic, Chinese, and French documents
using English queries show that no one technique is optimal for all queries, but that statistically
significant improvements in mean average precision over strong baselines can be achieved by
combining translation evidence from all three techniques.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2644  EndNode: 2900
These approaches have complementary strengths: MT makes good use of context
but at the cost of typically producing only one-best results, while token-to-token mappings
can produce n-best token translations but without leveraging available contextual clues.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 4507  EndNode: 4632
One method is to extract a context-aware
portion of the SCFG by selecting only the grammar rules that apply to a given query.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 4830  EndNode: 5093
Another solution is to perform translation in context using the full MT system on the entire
query and then to reconstruct context-sensitive token translation probabilities by accumulating
translation likelihood evidence from each of the top n query translations.

In this work we use a technique based on mapping term
statistics before computing term weights (Pirkola, 1998; Darwish and Oard, 2003), leading to a
representation known as Probabilistic Structured Queries (PSQ).
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 5828  EndNode: 5967
The best results are achieved when we
perform a linear interpolation of all three approaches (query-based, phrase-based, and token-
based).

One limitation of applying language and translation models in CLIR is that they have mostly
focused on isolated tokens (i.e., unigram models).
Label: METODE  StartNode: 13238  EndNode: 13393
In this paper, we explore ways to improve the baseline token-translation model discussed above
by exploiting the internal representations of the MT system.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 23819  EndNode: 24050
We evaluated our system on the latest available CLIR test collections for three languages:
TREC 2002 English-Arabic CLIR, NTCIR-8 English-Chinese Advanced Cross-Lingual Information
Access (ACLIA), and CLEF 2006 English-French CLIR.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 30874  EndNode: 31084
Based on the randomized significance test proposed by Smucker et al. (2007), the combined
approach (E) outperforms all models (except for the phrase-based approach) in the Arabic
collection with 95% confidence.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 31085  EndNode: 31325
When we ran the same test on the other two collections, we
found that the combined approach is significantly better than the baseline (A) and 1-best (D)
approaches for Chinese, whereas MAP is significantly higher than baseline A for French.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32439  EndNode: 32591
For French, the best retrieval effectiveness results from the n-best
full query translation model (C), significantly better than the baseline model (A).
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32592  EndNode: 32688
This shows
that there is no individual model that outperforms the rest in all three collections.
