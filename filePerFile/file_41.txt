The effect of selecting varying numbers and kinds of fea- 
tures for use in predicting category membership was inves- 
tigated on the Reuters and MUC-3 text categorization data 
sets.

The optimal feature set size for word-based indexing 
was found to be surprisingly low (10 to 15 features) despite 
the large training sets.

The extraction of new text features 
by syntactic analysis and feature clustering was investigated 
on the Reuters data set.

on the Reuters data set.

Syntactic indexing phrases, clus- 
ters of these phrases, and clusters of words were all found to 
provide less effective representations than individual words.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1549  EndNode: 1665
However, words have properties, 
such as synonymy and polysemy, that make them a less 
than ideal indexing language.

Syntactic phrase indexing and term clustering have op- 
posite effects on the properties of a text representation, 
which led us t o  investigate combining the two techniques 
[3].

However, the small size of standard text retrieval 
test collections, and the variety of approaches available 
for query interpretation, made it difficult to  study purely 
representational issues in text retrieval experiments.

Our first data  set was a set of 21,450 Reuters newswire 
stories from the year 1987 [4].

The second data set consisted of 1,500 documents from 
the US.  Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) 
that had previously been used in the MUC-3 evaluation 
of natural language processing systems [2].

The statistical model used in our experiments was pro- 
posed by Fuhr [5] for probabilistic text retrieval, but 
the adaptation to  text categorization is straightforward.

Each category is assigned to its top scoring documents 
on the test set in a designated multiple of the percentage 
of documents it was assigned to on the training corpus.

For the Reuters data we adopted a conservative approach 
to syntactic phrase indexing.

We experimented with forming clusters from 
words under three metafeature definitions, and from 
phrases under eight metafeature definitions 141.

Disappointingly, as shown in Figure 5, term cluster- 
ing did not significantly improve the quality of either 
a word-based or phrasal representation.

We have shown a statistical classifier trained on manu- 
ally categorized documents to achieve quite effective per- 
formance in assigning multiple, overlapping categories to 
documents.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 22089  EndNode: 22421
We have also shown, via studying text cate- 
gorization effectiveness, a variety of properties of index- 
ing languages that are difficult or impossible to measure 
directly in text retrieval experiments, uch as effects of 
feature set size and performance of phrasal representa- 
tions in isolation from word-based representations.
