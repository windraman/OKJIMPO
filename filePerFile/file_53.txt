The integration process includes fast feature
extraction with rule-based classification and label propa-
gation using connectivity analysis providing classified
areas in three categories: background, text and picture.

Document structure analysis and understand-
ing are the main processes in reaching this goal: ease of
use and availability of documents.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1332  EndNode: 1453
In order to achieve the best possible results with OCR and
storaging, the contents of the document have to be exam-
ined.

The PCS procedure combines the segmentation and classi-
fication parts.

The image is first divided into small nxn pixel windows,
where n is determined according to scanning resolution
and the size of the image.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 5872  EndNode: 5966
In our experiments, we used four simple features to clas-
sify each window to text or picture.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 5967  EndNode: 6193
These characteristics
were black/white-ratio inside the single window, average
black (thresholded) run-length and vertical cross-correla-
tion between neighbouring pixels and between the first and
every fifth (relative) pixel.

After extracting all the desired features, the classification
rules are formed.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 12222  EndNode: 12289
After the windows are classified the connectivity analysis
is next.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 12792  EndNode: 12882
For this purpose,
several different basic 3x3 and 4x4 (windows) masks have
been developed.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 15736  EndNode: 15857
Because each formed area gets a label that describes its
contents, the text areas are easy to search from the window
map.

After forming rectangle coordinates, the areas left inside
the  rectangles can be extracted from the original picture
for further processing, including OCR text recognition or
data storage.

The proposed segmentation and classification procedure
was tested with several images, some of which are shown
in the Figure 4.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 17237  EndNode: 17313
The percentage of the extracted text was 99-100% of all
text in test images.
