The discovery of regulatory pathways, signal cascades,
metabolic processes or diseasemodels requires knowledge on individ-
ual relations like e.g. physical or regulatory interactions between
genes and proteins.

Most interactions mentioned in the free text of
biomedical publications are not yet contained in structured databases.

We developed RelEx, an approach for relation extraction
from free text.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 810  EndNode: 948
It is based on natural language preprocessing producing
dependency parse trees and applying a small number of simple rules to
these trees.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 949  EndNode: 1160
We applied RelEx on a comprehensive set of one million
MEDLINE abstracts dealing with gene and protein relations and
extracted ~150000 relations with an estimated perfomance of both
80% precision and 80% recall.

Most biological facts are available only in the free text of scientific
articles. For information integration or combination with other types
of data, these facts have to be extracted from the scientific literature.

Extracted relations
exhibit high sensitivity but very low specificity.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 3856  EndNode: 4004
It uses a
small set of simple rules, building upon publicly available tools
applied for part-of-speech-tagging, noun-phrase-chunking and
dependency.

As an extension to standard relation extraction pipelines, we
propose the use of dependency parse trees (Klein and Manning,
2002, 2003; Mel’cuk, 1988) as a means for biomedical relation
extraction.

The RelEx work-flow (Figure 1) extracts directed qualified relations starting
from free-text sentences.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 6420  EndNode: 6532
RelEx creates candidate relations by extracting paths connecting pairs of
proteins from dependency parse trees. 
Label: DATA  StartNode: 14637  EndNode: 14810
The provided data consists of a synonym dictionary for genes/
proteins, a training set (55 sentences and 103 interactions) and a test
set (80 sentences and 54 interactions).
Label: DATA  StartNode: 14967  EndNode: 15297
The comprehensive subset of ?1 million MEDLINE abstracts deal-
ing with human gene and protein interactions from 1990 or newer
[for details see (Ku¨ffner et al., 2005)] and a synonym dictionary
(Fundel and Zimmer, 2006) containing 338 824 synonyms for
27 141 human genes and proteins were used for large-scale relation
extraction.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 15351  EndNode: 15491
We randomly selected a subset of 50 abstracts (called hprd50)
referenced by the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD)
(Peri et al., 2004).

Evalua-
tion results obtained on the LLL-challenge dataset (Figure 4,
F 75%, R 83%, P 68% on the training set; F 72%, R 78%,
P 68% for the basic test set) show that RelEx returns relations
with significantly higher recall and precision than the approaches
previously applied for the LLL-challenge [F 51.8%, R 53.8%,
P 50.0% for the basic and F 54.3%, R 53.0%, P 55.6% for the
linguistically enriched test set (Ne´dellec, 2005)].
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 19683  EndNode: 19809
For both datasets (LLL and hprd50) RelEx
achieves significantly higher precision and thus F-measure than
co-occurrence-search.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 23401  EndNode: 23530
RelEx extracts a significantly larger
number of relations from the abstracts than the number of interac-
tions contained in HPRD.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 26510  EndNode: 26681
If RelEx is compared on the rather stringent criteria of the LLL
challenge dataset (Ne´dellec, 2005), performance is significantly
higher than previously reported results.
