This paper presents WikiTranslate, a system which performs query 
translation for cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) using only Wikipedia 
to obtain translations.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 823  EndNode: 902
The system 
achieved a performance of 67% compared to the monolingual baseline.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1361  EndNode: 1462
The aim of this research is 
to explore the possibilities of Wikipedia for query translation in CLIR.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1465  EndNode: 1617
The main research question of this paper is: Is Wikipedia a viable alternative to 
current translation resources in cross-lingual information retrieval?
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1619  EndNode: 1706
We treat Wikipedia articles as representations of concepts (i.e. units of knowl-
edge).
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1856  EndNode: 2003
This raises 
the following sub questions: How can queries be mapped to Wikipedia concepts? and 
How to create a query given the Wikipedia concepts?
Label: METODE  StartNode: 4918  EndNode: 5126
The approach used by WikiTranslate consists of two important steps: mapping the 
query in source language to Wikipedia concepts and creating the final query in the 
target language using these found concepts.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 12315  EndNode: 12388
The system is first evaluated with the data of CLEF 
2006, 2005 and 2004.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 12389  EndNode: 12458
The best performing system is also evaluated with data of 
CLEF 2008.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 13806  EndNode: 13978
Averaging the runs with these settings 
over the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 shows us that Spanish had an average perform-
ance of 71.89% and French had an average of 76.78%.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 14085  EndNode: 14176
Including translations only as a phrase query results in a average 
MAP decrease of 0.0990.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 14244  EndNode: 14304
Including redirects showed an average MAP decrease of 0.118.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 14305  EndNode: 14368
Filtering non-
related words lead to an MAP increase of 0.0926.
