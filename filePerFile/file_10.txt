 In this work we describe our
approach to automatic section segmentation of clinical records such as hospital discharge summaries and radiology reports, along with
section classification into pre-defined section categories. 
Label: DATA  StartNode: 8393  EndNode: 8544
We used three datasets composed of discharge summaries
and radiology reports to develop our statistical section seg-
menter and test its performance. A
Label: DATA  StartNode: 8808  EndNode: 8925
This corpus consists of 430 discharge summaries of 402 pa-
tients who had a surgery at UW’s medical center in 20101.

Label: DATA  StartNode: 9526  EndNode: 9687
This corpus was created for the 2010 i2b2 natural language
processing challenge on medical concept, assertion, and re-
lation extraction (Uzuner et al., 2011). T
Label: DATA  StartNode: 10090  EndNode: 10188
This corpus consists of 100 radiology reports extracted
from the UW Radiology Information System.

Our basic methodology for section segmentation is to clas-
sify each line in a document to indicate its membership to a
section. Our classifier operates at the line-level rather than
the sentence-level, as content of clinical records tends to
be fragmentary and list-based. Similar to Hirohata et al.
(2008), we relied on BIO tags to differentiate the begin-
nings of sections (which tend to consist of headers) from
the remaining lines.
Under this methodology we tried two approaches: a joint
(one-step) approach and a pipeline (two-step) approach.
Both approaches are described below.

For Datasets 1 and 2, the performance results show that
the two-step approach (Experiments 2, 3, and 4) outper-
forms the one-step approach (Experiment 1). 
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 23709  EndNode: 23851
For Dataset 3, the two-step ap-
proach slightly decreased the performance; however, the
differences are too small to draw strong conclusions. 
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 23993  EndNode: 24161
This means the tagset used in the
one-step approach is much smaller, and thus the one-step
segmentation model can be better trained on a comparably
2005
small dataset.
