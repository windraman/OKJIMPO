The region con-
necting a pair of entities (in a parsed
sentence) is often used to construct ker-
nels or feature vectors that can recognize
and extract interesting relations.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 857  EndNode: 954
Such re-
gions are useful, but they can also incor-
porate unnecessary distracting informa-
tion.

A dozen simple rules are defined on out-
put from a deep parser.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1223  EndNode: 1302
Each rule specif-
ically examines the entities in one target
interaction pair. 
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2215  EndNode: 2367
The shortest paths between a pair of enti-
ties (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) or pair-enclosed
trees (Zhang et al., 2006) are widely used as focus
regions.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2368  EndNode: 2487
These regions are useful, but they can in-
clude unnecessary sub-paths such as appositions,
which cause noisy features.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 2580  EndNode: 2752
Instead of selecting the whole region between
a target pair, the target sentence is simplified
into simpler, pair-related, sentences using general,
task-independent, rules.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 5626  EndNode: 5816
Our method
relies on the deep parser; the rules depend on the
Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
used by Mogura, and all the rules are written for
the parser Enju XML output format.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 6276  EndNode: 6440
A clause-selection
rule constructs a simpler sentence (still includ-
ing both target entities) by removing noisy infor-
mation before and after the relevant clause.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 6441  EndNode: 6553
An
entity-phrase rule simplifies an entity-containing
region without changing the truth-value of the re-
lation.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 13097  EndNode: 13241
To elucidate the effect of the sentence simplifi-
cation, we applied the rules to five PPI corpora
and evaluated the PPI extraction performance.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 29813  EndNode: 29973
Using a few simple rules applicable
to the output of a deep parser called Mogura,
we showed that sentence simplification is effec-
tive for relation extraction.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 29974  EndNode: 30160
Applying all the rules
improved the performance on three of the five
corpora, while applying only the clause-selection
rules raised the performance for the remaining two
corpora as well.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 30161  EndNode: 30320
We analyzed the simplification
results, and showed that the simple rules are ap-
plicable with little danger of changing the truth-
values of the interactions.
