The goal of Information Extraction is to auto-
matically generate structured pieces of information from the
relevant information contained in text documents.

However,
elements of human supervision strongly bias the learning
process.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to
learning for Relation Detection, based on the use of massive
clustering ensembles.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 736  EndNode: 970
The results obtained on the ACE Relation Mention Detection
task outperform in terms of F1 score by 5 points the state of the
art of unsupervised techniques for this evaluation framework,
in addition to being simpler and more flexible.

IE systems require a significant amount of specific lin-
guistic knowledge, and the process of language or domain
adaptation of IE systems can hence require significant hu-
man effort.

In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible unsuper-
vised approach to learning for Relation Detection, based on
clustering, which reduces the elements of human supervision
and simplifies the use of enriched feature sets with respect
to other existing approaches.

Our approach is based on the transformation of Relation
Detection between entities of two given types, T1 and T2,
into a binary classification problem: each pair of entities
E1 and E2 of the proposed types co-occurring in the
same sentence has to be classified as related or unrelated.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 6799  EndNode: 6871
To classify each pair, we use a two-step scoring-filtering
architecture.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 6987  EndNode: 7207
A scorer is used to calculate the score for this
instance, s(x), and a filterer assigns it to the related or
unrelated class according to whether this score is above or
below a relatedness threshold, threl, respectively.

As learning corpus we used the year 2000 subset of the
Associated Press section of the AQUAINT Corpus.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 19762  EndNode: 19877
As mentioned, as test corpus we used data from the Rela-
tion Detection and Recognition task of the ACE evaluation.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 19878  EndNode: 19967
Specifically, we used the training data of ACE evaluations
for years 2003, 2004 and 2008.

 Our approach obtains a F1 measure
of 55.7, more than 4 points above the upper bound of
51.0 attainable by the other system, with both using only
POS information.

Additionally, we have shown that learning using a massive
combination of clusterings improves the performance of
the scorer, with respect to a learner based on a single
clustering model and a model selection criterion.
