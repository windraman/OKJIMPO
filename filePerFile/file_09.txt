Text documents convey valuable structured information. For
example, medical literature contains information about new
treatments for diseases.

We present gen-
eral Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms for estimat-
ing pattern and tuple confidence. Our specific contributions
include:
• A formalization of the pattern confidence estimation
problem (Section 2).
?Microsoft Research Email:eugeneag@microsoft.com
• A general EM-based method for estimating the confi-
dence of automatically generated patterns and the ex-
tracted relation tuples (Section 3).
• An evaluation of different pattern weighting methods
over multiple relation extraction tasks (Section 5).

Our goal is to extract structured relations between named en-
tities (e.g., a company name, a location name, or a name of
a drug or a disease) from unstructured documents with min-
imal human effort.

Data Sets and Relations: We used three relations ex-
tracted from a collection of 145,000 articles from the New
York Times from 1996, available as part of the North Amer-
ican News Text Corpus1.

As we conjectured,
for this relation (which lacks true integrity constraints), the
EM-based methods have higher accuracy than the constraint-
based method.
