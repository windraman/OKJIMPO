Semantic information was used (1) to enhance a
dependency tree kernel; and (2) to build semantic
dependency structures used for enhanced relation
extraction for several semantic classifiers.

One
way of automatically identifying information of interest from
the vast Internet resources is by recognizing relevant entities
and meaningful relations they share.

We explored two main resources: PropBank and
FrameNet.

We used the
semantic information identified by the parsers in two ways.

Instead of using
the entire dependency tree to compute similarities, we se-
lected sub-trees that contain nodes having values for the fea-
tures from set F2 (illustrated in Figure 7).

To evaluate the role of shallow semantics provided by se-
mantic parsers on relation extraction we have used the Auto-
matic Content Extraction (ACE) corpus available from LDC
(LDC2003T11).

We used each kernel within an SVM (we augmented the
SVMlight implementation to include our kernels).
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 30169  EndNode: 30350
The results indicate that
on average, for K4, the best performing kernel, we obtained
an increase of 24.66% in the F-score when features provided
by the semantic parsers were added.

The re-
sults show that frame semantics produce an enhancement of
53.24% over previous state-of-art results in relation extrac-
tion.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32002  EndNode: 32135
This structure enabled the extraction of rele-
vant relations with better performance than previous state-of-
the-art kernel methods.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32136  EndNode: 32254
Furthermore, the semantic features
enabled similarly good results to be obtained with a few other
learning algorithms.
