To get all possible English senses for every Japanese term, the online dictionary SPACEALC is 
utilized.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 734  EndNode: 847
The EWC semantic relatedness measure is used to select the most related meanings for the results 
of translation.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 848  EndNode: 984
This measure combines the Wikipedia-based Explicit Semantic Analysis measure, the 
WordNet path measure and the mixed collocation index.

Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) can 
be used to retrieve documents in one language in 
response to a query given in another.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1351  EndNode: 1574
The usual 
approach consists of two steps: 1) translation of the 
user query into the target language and then 2) 
retrieval of documents in this language by using a 
conventional mono-lingual information retrieval 
system.

In this paper, we 
propose a novel approach to translate queries for a 
Japanese-English CLIR task.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 2056  EndNode: 2137
We assume that terms 
in any query should be semantically related to each 
other.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 2183  EndNode: 2273
After segmenting the queries, we obtain full sets of 
translations for each Japanese term.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 2274  EndNode: 2360
The final step is 
to select the most semantically related alternatives 
applying EWC.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 8140  EndNode: 8268
The NTCIR CLIR data collection (NTCIR, 
2011) consisting of 187,000 articles in English was 
used as a data set for experiments.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 12561  EndNode: 12636
Retrieval performance with queries generated 
utilizing Mecab was very low.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 15330  EndNode: 15497
Our preliminary experiments showed the 
superiority of the longest much technique applying 
SPACEALC over Mecab: Segmentation of Japanese 
texts is much more accurate.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 17129  EndNode: 17259
Results of preliminary 
experiments showed that queries generated are 
similar to queries obtained from Google Translate 
service.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 17260  EndNode: 17451
The performance of the retrieval system for 
queries generated by the proposed approach is 
slightly worse compared to the performance for the 
queries obtained from Google Translate service.
