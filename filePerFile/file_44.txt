Currently, IE
systems are usually domain-dependent and adapting
the system to a new domain requires a high amount
of manual labour, such as specifying and implement-
ing relation–specific extraction patterns manually (cf.
Fig. 1) or annotating large amounts of training cor-
pora (cf. Fig. 2).
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1705  EndNode: 1857
Consequently, current IE technology is highly
statically and inflexible with respect to a timely adap-
tation to new requirements in form of new topics.

In order to restrict the processing to sen-
tences written in English, we apply a language guesser
tool, lc4j (Lc4j, 2007) and remove sentences not clas-
sified as written in English.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 7065  EndNode: 7221
To all remaining sentences, we apply LingPipe (Ling-
Pipe, 2007) for sentence boundary detection, named
entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 7482  EndNode: 7564
We define a sentence to be
of potential relevance if it at least contains two NEs.

We can now extract
verb relations using a simple algorithm: We define a
verb relation to be a verb together with its arguments
(subject(s), object(s) and prepositional phrases) and
consider only those relations to be of interest where at
least the subject or the object is an NE.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 9792  EndNode: 9942
We thus de-
cided to use a scoring algorithm that compares a re-
lation to other relations based on certain aspects and
calculates a similarity score.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 10038  EndNode: 10165
Similarity is measured based on the output from the
different preprocessing steps as well as lexical informa-
tion from WordNet

For our experiments, we built a test corpus of doc-
uments related to the topic “Berlin Hauptbahnhof”
by sending queries describing the topic (e.g., “Berlin
Hauptbahnhof”, “Berlin central station”) to Google
and downloading the retrieved documents specifying
English as the target language.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 11989  EndNode: 12136
From the extracted relations, the system built 306 clus-
ters of two or more instances, which were manually
evaluated by two authors of this paper.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 12137  EndNode: 12295
81 of our clus-
ters contain two or more instances of exactly the same
relation, mostly due to the same sentence appearing
in several documents of the corpus.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 12296  EndNode: 12550
Of the remaining
225 clusters, 121 were marked as consistent (i.e., all in-
stances in the cluster express a similar relation), 35 as
partly consistent (i.e., more than half of the instances
in the cluster express a similar relation), 69 as not use-
ful.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 13039  EndNode: 13219
Of our 121 consistent clusters, 76 were classified as be-
ing of the type ’same pattern’, 27 as being of the type
’same topic’ and 18 as being of the type ’relation para-
phrases’.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 13941  EndNode: 14061
For the same sentences, the IDEX system extracted 27
relations, 11 of them corresponding to the manually
extracted ones.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 14062  EndNode: 14125
This yields a recall value of 73% and
a precision value of 41%.
