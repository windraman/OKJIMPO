 In this article, an efficient linear text 
segmentation algorithm based on hierarchical agglomerative 
clustering is presented.

To tackle the problems mentioned above, a novel 
efficient linear text segmentation algorithm based on 
Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is presented 
in this article.

In this section, an efficient linear text segmentation 
algorithm (called TSHAC), which considers both 
computational complexity and segmentation accuracy, is 
proposed. The process of TSHAC consists of 4 steps. At first, 
a long text is preprocessed; tokenization, stopword removal, 
and stemming are conducted to construct the vocabulary of 
the text. After text preprocessing, the text can be represented 
as vectors, each of which represents a sentence within the 
text. A part of sentence similarities are then computed to 
construct the sentence-similarity matrix. Finally, the optimal 
topic boundaries are identified by the proposed algorithm.

To evaluate the performance of TSHAC, a publicly 
available test corpus is adopted. The test corpus was created 
by Choi [3] and has been commonly used in previous 
researches. The test corpus consists of 700 samples. A 
sample is a concatenation of ten text segments. A segment is 
the first n sentences of a randomly selected document from 
the Brown corpus. The 700 samples are divided into 4 sets 
according to the range of the number of sentences.

The experimental results in Table II are reported when 
the number of segments is unknown in advance. 
From Table II, the proposed linear text segmentation 
algorithm (i.e., TSHAC) outperforms the linear time 
algorithm, TextTiling, and the more complex algorithms, 
C99. TSHAC also provides comparable results with other 
algorithms. Moreover, unlike TSF, which requires manpower 
to designate parameters used, TSHAC provides a fully 
automatic process for linear text segmentation without 
auxiliary knowledge base, parameter setting, or user 
involvement.
