The novelty lies in exploiting the diversity
of concepts in text for summarization, which has not re-
ceived much attention in the summarization literature.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 535  EndNode: 669
A
diversity-based approach here is a principled generalization
of Maximal Marginal Relevance criterion by Carbonell and
Goldstein [3].

We propose, in addition, an information-centric approach
to evaluation, where the quality of summaries is judged not
in terms of how well they match human-created summaries
but in terms of how well they represent their source docu-
ments in IR tasks such document retrieval and text catego-
rization.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 971  EndNode: 1233
To ?nd the e?ectiveness of our approach under the pro-
posed evaluation scheme, we set out to examine how a sys-
tem with the diversity functionality performs against one
without, using the BMIR-J2 corpus, a test data developed
by a Japanese research consortium.

The results demonstrate
a clear superiority of a diversity based approach to a non-
diversity based approach.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1757  EndNode: 1950
One
of the problems with the former approach has to do with its
underlying assumption that human-made summaries are re-
liable enough to be used as “gold standards” for automatic
summarization.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2968  EndNode: 3221
Another problem associated with the approach concerns
the portability of a summarization system: deploying the
system in a new domain usually requires one to collect a
large amount of data, which need to be manually annotated,
and then train the system.

We evaluate summaries, not in terms of how well
they match human-made extracts [9, 6], nor in terms of how
much time it takes for humans to make relevance judgments
on them [12], but in terms of how well they represent source
documents in usual IR tasks such as document retrieval and
text categorization.

Roughly,
the summarizer consists of the following two operations:
1. Find-Diversity: Find diverse topic areas in text.
2. Reduce-Redundancy: From each topic area, iden-
tify the most important sentence and take that sen-
tence as a representative of the area.

We have conducted experiments using BMIR-J2.

At compression rates between 20% and 40%, despite
some outliers, DBS/XM performs better for the majority
of queries than Z-model, but breaks even at 50%.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 26835  EndNode: 26960
On the other hand, under MRS,
DBS/XM turned out to be signi?cantly di?erent from Z-
model at every compression rate examined.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32940  EndNode: 32999
DBS/XM performs consistently better
than Z-model under MRS.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 33380  EndNode: 33507
Under this scheme,
diversity-based summarization (DBS/XM ) was found to be
superior to relevance-based summarization (Z-model).
