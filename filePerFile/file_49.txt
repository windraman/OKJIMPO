This algorithm
is based on the well-known TextTiling algo-
rithm, and segments documents using the La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 497  EndNode: 674
We show that using the mode topic ID as-
signed during the inference method of LDA,
used to annotate unseen documents, improves
performance by stabilizing the obtained top-
ics.

We show significant improvements over
state of the art segmentation algorithms on two
standard datasets.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 780  EndNode: 948
As an additional benefit,
TopicTiling performs the segmentation in lin-
ear time and thus is computationally less ex-
pensive than other LDA-based segmentation
methods.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 964  EndNode: 1106
The task tackled in this paper is Text Segmentation
(TS), which is to be understood as the segmentation
of texts into topically similar units.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1210  EndNode: 1307
The chal-
lenge for a text segmentation algorithm is to find the
sub-topical structure of a text.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1583  EndNode: 1665
TopicTiling uses
topic IDs, obtained by the LDA inference method,
instead of words
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1842  EndNode: 1963
We de-
note this most probable topic ID as the mode (most
frequent across all inference steps) of the topic as-
signment.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1964  EndNode: 2134
These IDs are used to calculate the co-
sine similarity between two adjacent blocks of sen-
tences, represented as two vectors, containing the
frequency of each topic ID.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 7639  EndNode: 7742
To calculate the coherence score, we exclusively
use the topic IDs assigned to the words by infer-
ence
Label: METODE  StartNode: 7943  EndNode: 8042
The coherence score is calculated by the vector dot
product, also referred to as cosine similarity.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 9687  EndNode: 9851
The performance of the introduced algorithm is
demonstrated using two datasets: A dataset pro-
posed by Choi and another more challenging one as-
sembled by Galley.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 15412  EndNode: 15532
Using a one-sampled t-
test with ? = 0.05 we can state significant improve-
ments in comparison to all other algorithms.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 17212  EndNode: 17360
Considering
the unfiltered results we observe that results improve
when using the mode assigned topic ID and a win-
dow of larger than one sentence.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 17585  EndNode: 17726
Fil-
tering the documents for parts of speech leads to ?
1% absolute error rate reduction, as can be seen in
the last two columns of Table 4.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 17727  EndNode: 17826
Again, we observe
that the mode assignment always leads to better re-
sults, gaining at least 0.6%.
