We
translate queries with Google Translate and extend them with new trans-
lations obtained by mapping noun phrases in the query to concepts in
the target language using Wikipedia.

Multilingual information search becomes increasingly important due to the grow-
ing amount of online information available in non-English languages and the rise
of multilingual document collections.

Query translation for CLIR became the
most widely used technique to access documents in a different language from
the query.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1145  EndNode: 1294
As CLIR is less accurate than monolingual IR, the combination of
query translation techniques is a promising way to approximate monolingual
accuracy.

Combination of statistical machine translation (SMT),
machine readable dictionary (MRD) based models or similarity thesauri (ST)
proved to be difficult [1] due to the difference in the accuracy of individual mod-
els (SMT tends to be superior); the aggregation of translation errors; or the
topic drift caused by integrating multiple translations in a single query.

As a baseline CLIR model, we use query translation by
Google Translate.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 3343  EndNode: 3493
To exploit this, we mine all
redirect and cross-language links to build a translation table which maps con-
cepts to their target language equivalent.

To map queries to Wikipedia concepts (titles), we first try to map the
whole query, and then gradually proceed with mapping shorter word sequences.

We used two CLIR collections introduced in the CLEF
Domain Specific (DS) and Ad Hoc (AH) tracks.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 7428  EndNode: 7670
As can be seen in Table 1, the individual CLIR models perform similar to
the results reported in previous works: the Wikipedia model achieves 50-80%
of the monolingual result, while Google Translate performs around 90% of the
monolingual run.

The Wikipedia based concept mapping performs slightly worse
than the more complex WP model by [5] but we use just title fields.

As regards the combination of the Wikipedia based and the Google trans-
lations, we see consistent improvements over the CLIR models using a single
translation.

In this study, we introduced a simple CLIR model using Wikipedia, mapping
concepts in one language to their equivalents in another language based on the
redirect and cross-language links in multilingual Wikipedia versions.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 8905  EndNode: 9046
This simple
WP-based model performs similar to previous results obtained by Wikipedia-
based CLIR (60-70% accuracy of monolingual retrieval).
