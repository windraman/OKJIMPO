Text classification is the process of automatically 
assigning predefined categories to free text, which is very 
important to information retrieval and many other 
applications.

In 
this paper, an effective and efficient new method called 
variance-mean based feature filtering method of feature 
selection to do feature reduction in the representation phase 
for text classification is proposed. It keeps the best features, 
and thus improves the final performance e.g. macro-f1 to 0.92 
and simultaneously decreases the computing time for 
representing the incoming text waiting to be classified 
dramatically, which is important because it occurs on line and 
is time-critical.

 In this paper, we 
propose a new approach to feature selection to do feature 
reduction, which is a constituent process in representing 
texts. Using SVM as the classifier, the macro-precision, 
macro-recall and macro-f1 used to evaluate the 
performance shown by our experiment are high

The corpus used for training and testing is the 
“Chinese text classification corpus” given by Ronglu Li 
published on the website http://www.nlp.org.cn. We divide 
the corpus into two non-intersected sets: a training set 
containing 10 categories with 100 texts in each and a test 
set containing the same 10 categories with another 100 texts 
in each also

Compared with the classical document frequency 
incorporated feature filtering methods analyzed in section 4, 
such as DF, CHI used in our experiment, it shows in Figure 
1, that our method can gain higher performance at a very 
low dimension, and quickly reach a peak, which means 
much less computing time and almost best performance 
while the other two classical methods and the like only 
show a slow ascend tendency from a lower performance 
evaluation value without a peak until the dimension reaches 
to almost the original one, which means decreasing the 
dimension dramatically without great loss of performance is 
hard to realize.
