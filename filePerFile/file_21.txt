We address the problem of evaluating the effectiveness of
summarization techniques for the task of document catego-
rization.

In this work, we focus on the task of au-
tomatic document categorization in scenarios where a doc-
ument’s summary is functionally equivalent to reducing the
number of features of the original.

We
argue that, for the task of automatic text categorization,
an ideal task-specific summary can be narrowly defined as
the subset of most-informative features selected specifically
with the categorization performance in mind.

In their ex-
periments with a probabilistic TF-IDF based classifier, they
showed that title-based document descriptors resulted in re-
spectable levels of categorization performance.

We used the Reuters-21578 collection’ as a testbed  for our

To quantify the arguments advanced in this paper, we con-
sidered a number of simple extraction-based techniques ~
the details are given in list below. Similar heuristics-based
techniques have been used for example in [16]  [5]  [17].  In all
cases, a word occurring at least 3 times in the body of a doc-
ument was considered a keyword, while a word occurring at
least once in the title of a story was considered a title word.

We have proposed a framework for evaluating summariza-
tion methods in the context of their utility as feature selec-
tors in automatic text categorization. 
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 24112  EndNode: 24270
 Our approach is well
suited for classifiers utilizing binary feature vectors, where a
feature corresponds to the presence or absence of a word in
a document.
