We introduce a stochastic graph-based method for computing relative importance of
textual units for Natural Language Processing.

We introduce a stochastic graph-based method for computing relative importance of

Extractive TS relies on the concept of sentence salience
to identify the most important sentences in a document or set of documents.

The results show that
degree-based methods (including LexRank) outperform both centroid-based methods and
other systems participating in DUC in most of the cases.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 1574  EndNode: 1696
Furthermore, the LexRank
with threshold method outperforms the other degree-based techniques including continuous
LexRank.

In this paper, we focus
on multi-document extractive generic text summarization, where the goal is to produce a
summary of multiple documents about the same, but unspecified topic.

All of our
approaches are based on the concept of prestige2 in social networks, which has also inspired
many ideas in computer networks and information retrieval.

We hypothesize that the sentences
that are similar to many of the other sentences in a cluster are more central (or salient)
to the topic.

We define degree centrality of a
sentence as the degree of the corresponding node in the similarity graph.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 13933  EndNode: 14058
When computing degree centrality, we have treated each edge as a vote to determine the
overall centrality value of each node.

We used DUC 2003 and 2004 data sets in our experiments.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 36740  EndNode: 36891
All of our
three new methods (Degree, LexRank with threshold, and continuous LexRank) perform
significantly better than the baselines in all data sets.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 36892  EndNode: 37048
They also perform better than
centroid-based summaries except for the DUC 2003 data set where the difference between
Centroid and the others is not obvious.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 47785  EndNode: 47942
Lastly, we have
shown that our methods are quite insensitive to noisy data that often occurs as a result of
imperfect topical document clustering algorithms.
