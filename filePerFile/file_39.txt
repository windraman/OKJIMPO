This work evaluates a system that uses in-
terpolated predictions of reading difficulty 
that are based on both vocabulary and 
grammatical features.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1346  EndNode: 1458
An automatic measure of read-
ability that incorporated both lexical and gram-
matical features was thus needed.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2603  EndNode: 2836
One goal of 
this work is to show that the use of pedagogically 
motivated grammatical features (e.g., passive 
voice, rather than the number of words per sen-
tence) can improve readability measures based on 
lexical features alone.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 4471  EndNode: 4600
This phenome-
non suggests that grammatical features may play a 
more important role in predicting and measuring 
L2 readability.

The statistical model used for this study is 
based on a variation of the multinomial Na√Øve 
Bayes classifier.

The language models employed in this work are 
simple: they are based on unigrams and assume 
that the probability of a token is independent of the 
surrounding tokens.

The Stanford Parser (Klein and Man-
ning, 2002) was used to produce constituent struc-
ture trees.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 12886  EndNode: 13034
Once a document is parsed, the predictor uses 
Tgrep2 (Rohde, 2005), a tree structure searching 
tool, to identify instances of the target patterns.

A k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm is used for 
classification based on the grammatical features 
described above.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 20751  EndNode: 20873
The first corpus was from a set of texts 
gathered from the Web for a prior evaluation of the 
language modeling approach.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 21078  EndNode: 21392
The second corpora consisted of textbook mate-
rials (Adelson-Goldstein and Howard, 2004, for 
level 2; Ediger and Pavlik, 2000, for levels 3 and 4; 
Silberstein, 2002, for level 5) from a series of Eng-
lish as a Second Language reading courses at the 
English Language Institute at the University of 
Pittsburgh.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 23320  EndNode: 23510
The results show that for both the first and sec-
ond language corpora, the language modeling 
(LM) approach alone produced more accurate pre-
dictions than the grammar-based approach alone.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 23682  EndNode: 23897
The results also indicate that while grammar-
based predictions are not as accurate as the vo-
cabulary-based scores, they can be combined with 
vocabulary-based scores to produce more accurate 
interpolated scores.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 28381  EndNode: 28574
When interpolated 
with grammar-based scores, the reduction of mean 
squared error over the language modeling approach 
for L1 was only 7%, while for L2 the reduction or 
squared error was 22%.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 29117  EndNode: 29351
Although a vocabulary-based language 
modeling approach outperformed the grammar-
based predictor, an interpolated measure using 
confidence scores for the grammar-based predic-
tions showed improvement over both individual 
measures.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 29353  EndNode: 29473
Also, grammar appears to play a more 
important role in second language readability than 
in first language readability.
