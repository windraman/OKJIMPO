This paper presents a supervised method for the detection and extraction of Causal Relations from open domain text. 
Label: METODE  StartNode: 665  EndNode: 850
Our approach first identifies the syntactic patterns that may encode a
causation, then we use Machine Learning techniques to decide whether or not a pattern instance encodes a causation
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1283  EndNode: 1443
The automatic detection and extraction of Semantic Rela-
tions is a crucial step to improve the performance of several
Natural Language Processing applications.

Our method for the detection and extraction of causations
is based on the use of syntactic patterns that may encode
causation.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 6470  EndNode: 6615
We manually classified 1270 sentences from the TREC5
corpus into encoding or not encoding causation; 170 in-
trasentencial causations were found.

We performed our experiments using the semantically an-
notated SemCor 2.1 corpus.

Again, the results are good.

Examining the trees learned we can conclude that most of
the possible semantic classes are not covered.

We have proposed a system for the detection of marked and
explicit causations between a verb phrase and a subordi-
nate clause which yields a high performance.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 15273  EndNode: 15360
The system
is relatively simple and is able to detect causations from
open domain text.
