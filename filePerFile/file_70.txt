This paper reports experimental results of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) from 
German to French, in which a hybrid approach of query and document translation was attempted, 
i.e, combining results of query translation (German to French) and of document translation 
(French to German).

In order to avoid too high complexity of computation for translating a large 
amount of texts in documents, we executed pseudo-translation, i.e., a simple replacement of terms 
by a bilingual dictionary (for query translation, a machine translation system was used).

In 
particular, since English was used as an intermediary language for both translation directions of 
German and French, English translations at the middle stage were employed as document 
representations in order to reduce the number of translation steps.

By omitting a translation step 
(English to German), the performance was improved.

Our focus in this experiment is on examining search performance of a hybrid approach 
combining query translation and document translation, in which English is employed as an intermediary 
language for translation.

Some researchers have already attempted to merge two results from query and document translation for 
enhancing effectiveness of CLIR.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2391  EndNode: 2700
One problem for implementing 
this approach is that the document translation is usually a cost-intensive task, but we can alleviate it by using 
simpler translation techniques, e.g., “pseudo translation” [1] in which each term is simply replaced with its 
corresponding translations by a bilingual dictionary.

The target French collection includes 177,452 documents in total. The average document length is 232.65 words.

As shown in Table 1, the hybrid approach using English documents translated from the original collection 
(hybrid-2, SrgMgE03) outperforms another hybrid approach using German documents (hybrid-1, SrgdMgG02), 
i.e., the scores of mean average precision (MAP) are 0.2605 for hybrid-2 and 0.2492 for hybrid-1.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 16345  EndNode: 16550
Unfortunately, the hyper approach could not show better performance than a simple query translation 
approach (SrgdQT04), i.e., its score of MAP is 0.2658, which is slightly greater than that of SrgdMgE03.

Unfortunately, our hybrid approach could not show better effectiveness than a simple query translation approach 
partly because the performance of document translation is poor.
