The extraction of information from the content of these
sources is a challenging problem and a hard task since they are het-
erogeneous and dynamic.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 398  EndNode: 538
This paper presents a new method for ex-
tracting wrappers and relations from the web using both page encod-
ing and context generalization.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 633  EndNode: 740
Multiple patterns
are then extracted considering the occurrences of the input instances
in the data source.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1946  EndNode: 1999
Our method represents a wrapper as a set of patterns.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 2000  EndNode: 2096
We consider
that the user wants to extract a relation from a given document or set
of documents.

Wrapper induction was first introduced by N.
Kushmerick [10].
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 4786  EndNode: 4904
The problem we resolve in this paper is to build a wrapper for a
data source which can extract a relation it contains.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 8546  EndNode: 8597
Our method is based on encoding and generalization.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 8636  EndNode: 8767
We have evaluated our method on three different types of data
sources : search-engines, product catalogs and bibliography listings.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 9399  EndNode: 9489
Our method works quite well on the output of
search engines as it is shown by table below.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 10079  EndNode: 10194
All the built wrappers correctly
extract the full page with a couple of instances as can be seen the ta-
ble below.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 11878  EndNode: 11999
In the worst case, when
all the examples need to be given, the wrapper generated can still
work on other generated pages.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 13419  EndNode: 13572
The proposed method can wrap up many
different types of site, is robust to irregularities in format and makes
use of structure contained in content text.
