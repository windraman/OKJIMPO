A novel
representation is introduced based on
generic relation extraction (GRE), which
aims to build systems for relation iden-
tification and characterisation that can be
transferred across domains and tasks with-
out modification of model parameters.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 4445  EndNode: 4597
The problem
is that these shallow features often break down
where underlying linguistic content needs to be
compared rather than just surface structure.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 5522  EndNode: 5772
The problem with these systems is that they all
use supervised approaches to IE that require that
the IE templates be known in advance and addi-
tionally require significant investment in writing
extraction rules or in annotating data for train-
ing.

The GRE models
used here do rely on dependency parsing.

For the sake of comparison, the current evaluation
adopts the Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou (2004)
summarisation framework.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 9338  EndNode: 9528
The experiments here use the multi-document
summarisation data from the 2001 Document Un-
derstanding Conference (DUC),
8
which is the
same data used by Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou
(2004).

The results demonstrate unambigu-
ously that the event and relation representations
outperform the tf*idf representation, with strongly
significant p-values less than 0.001 for both Rouge
measures and all summary lengths.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 14127  EndNode: 14370
Results suggest that
the entity pair model based on GRE data out-
performs the entity pair model based on atomic
events, at least for medium sized summaries of
100 and 200 words where ER is significantly better
than EE for both Rouge measures.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 14484  EndNode: 14672
The scores for the entity
pair representations reported in Table 3 are statisti-
cally indistinguishable from those for correspond-
ing relation and event representations in Table 2
above.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 26359  EndNode: 26511
Performance for the re-
lation representation is significantly better than a
non-trivial tf*idf baseline across the range of sum-
mary lengths explored.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 26512  EndNode: 26625
Performance is also at
least as good as a comparable but less general rep-
resentation based on event extraction.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 26626  EndNode: 26771
Correlation
analysis suggests that different representations are
complementary due to the fact that they perform
well on different document sets.
