In Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) process, the translation effects have a direct impact on the 
accuracy of follow-up retrieval results.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 606  EndNode: 803
In dictionary-based approach, we are dealing with the words that 
have more than one meaning which can decrease the retrieval performance if the query translation return an 
incorrect translations.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 864  EndNode: 1089
In this study we proposed 
a Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) method based on domain ontology using Quran concepts 
for disambiguating translation of the query and to improve the dictionary-based query translation.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 1629  EndNode: 1817
The experimental result shows that our proposed method brings significant improvement in retrieval 
accuracy for English document collections, but deficient for Malay document collections.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 10431  EndNode: 10591
In this approach, we use the cosine 
similarity between the document vector and a concepts 
vector as a measure of the score of the concepts for that 
document.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 11168  EndNode: 11324
Based on category, subcategories and related 
concepts in Quran ontology, we build a bilingual 
ontology, consists of Quran concepts and document 
concepts.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 11986  EndNode: 12180
To 
reduce this type of problems, we use term in the 
bilingual dictionary together with term and their 
translation from the bilingual ontology to build a new 
combination bilingual dictionary.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 12341  EndNode: 12774
We adopted two basics approaches from Rais et al. 
(2011) work: (1) using the first translation listed in the 
dictionary, motivated by the fact that the first translation 
is often the most frequently used; and (2) using all the 
translation candidates, motivated by the fact that when 
all the translation candidates are used, one can include all 
the possible expressions in the target language and obtain 
query expansion effect.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 16751  EndNode: 16973
To evaluate the 
effectiveness of the proposed CLIR method, we used 
Malay-English documents sets from actual Malay 
Quran collection and actual English Quran collection 
from Abdullah (2006) to verify the proposed method.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 18945  EndNode: 19157
As shown in Table 4, the English document MAP 
results for IR2 were 2.1 and 5.1% lower than mono IR1 
result and the Malay document MAP results for IR2 
were 3.4 and 7.5% lower than mono IR1 result, as 
expected.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 19158  EndNode: 19324
The English document MAP result for IR3 is 
higher than IR2 by 2 and 0.6% and the Malay document 
MAP result for IR3 is lower than IR2 by 2.5 and 2.8%, 
respectively.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 19502  EndNode: 19652
As can be seen in this figure, 
dictionary-based CLIR approach in IR2, showed 
decreasing in retrieval performance compared to 
Mono IR system in IR1.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 21460  EndNode: 21640
As shown in 
Table 4, the MAP results for using first translation were 
3% and 4.1% higher than using all translation candidates 
result for English and Malay document collections.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 23810  EndNode: 24081
Translation approach in IR2 and IR3, showed that 
CLIR query translation using first translation listed in the 
dictionary is obtained a better result compared to using 
all translation candidates listed in the dictionary either in 
English or Malay document collections.
