 In this
paper we propose a framework for large-scale
evaluation of relation extraction systems based
on an automatic annotator that uses a public
online database and a large web corpus.

Measuring true precision and recall In this pa-
per we discuss an automatic method to estimate true
precision and recall of open RE systems. We pro-
pose the use of an automatic annotator: a system
capable of verifying whether or not a fact was cor-
rectly extracted. This is done by leveraging exter-
nal sources of data and text, which are not avail-
able to the systems being evaluated.

 A fact is
a triple fi = ?e1, r, e2? associating entities e1 and
e2 via relation r.

We now use our evaluation method to compare two
open RE systems: ReVerb and SONEX. The input
corpus for this comparison is the New York Times
corpus, composed by 1.8 million documents.
ReVerb (Fader et al., 2011) extracts relational
phrases using rules over part-of-speech tags and
noun-phrase chunks.

We found
about 63 million facts in G?, the superset of the
ground truth G.
