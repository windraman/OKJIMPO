This paper proposes a method of query trans-
lation for Cross Language Information Re-
trieval.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 449  EndNode: 585
The method uses a parallel bilingual
corpus to produce word vectors and can read-
ily be applied to monolingual vector-retrieval
models.

A cross language information retrieval (CLIR)
system is a system for retrieving documents across
language boundaries.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 926  EndNode: 1043
A query written in one language
should be translated into a representation for finding
documents in another language.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1839  EndNode: 1972
In the information mapping approach,
we use a multidimensional vector space, called word
space for defining the association of words.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 3973  EndNode: 4146
Our basic idea for applying the information map-
ping approach to CLIR is to produce a vector for a
word in one language L with content-bearing words in
another language L'.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 4148  EndNode: 4213
We use a bilingual parallel cor-
pus to produce the word vectors.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 5277  EndNode: 5367
We used an English-Japanese bilingual patent ab-
stract corpus for our experimental tests.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 9277  EndNode: 9410
All four Tables
show good results; a total of 1559 out of 1600 (97.4%)
queries retrieved their counterpart patents at the first
rank.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 10124  EndNode: 10222
A total of
735 out of 800 (91.9%) queries retrieved their counter-
part patents at the first rank.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 11909  EndNode: 12110
A total of 334 out of 400 (83.5 %) counter-
part English patent abstracts were correctly retrieved at
the first rank and 361 out of 400 (90.3 %) were re-
trieved in the top 3 by the Japanese sentences.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 12518  EndNode: 12715
A total of 310 out of 400
(77.5 %) counterpart Japanese patent abstracts were
correctly retrieved at the first rank and 360 out of 400
(90.0 %) were retrieved in the top 3 by the English
sentences.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 13345  EndNode: 13520
The CLIR
system produced with the method showed 97.4% accu-
racy in our preliminary tests of finding the counter-
parts in a parallel corpus of English and Japanese pat-
ents.
