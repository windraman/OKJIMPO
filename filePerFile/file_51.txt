In order to examine
the properties of these seven techniques we performed a series
of similarity and classi?cation experiments on eleven DNA
microarray datasets.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2186  EndNode: 2320
One of the most prevalent problems in DNA microarray
datasets is the large degree of high dimensionality that is
inherent in the data.

Feature selection refers to a diverse series of techniques
from the ?eld of data mining designed for the reduction of
the dimensionality of a dataset.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 3080  EndNode: 3261
However, there are a number of feature selection tech-
niques which are computationally infeasible due to the se-
vere level of high dimensionality found in DNA microarray
datasets.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 3623  EndNode: 3774
Thus, for datasets with such extreme
degrees of high dimensionality, the most appropriate choice
of selection approach is univariate feature selection.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 4301  EndNode: 4488
This paper presents a set of seven univariate feature
selection techniques which we have combined into a family
of techniques we name First Order Statistics (FOS) based
feature selection.

The datasets are all DNA
microarray datasets acquired from a number of different real
world bioinformatics, genetics, and medical projects.

Our group decided to use twelve
feature subset sizes for this experiment: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50,
75, 100, 200, 350, 500, and 1000.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 16044  EndNode: 16139
We decided to use consistency index [4] because it takes
into consideration bias due to chance.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 16831  EndNode: 16952
In this study we use three different classi?ers or learners
to evaluate the classi?cation power of the seven FOS rankers.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 16953  EndNode: 17041
The three classi?ers used in this study are SVM, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 25749  EndNode: 25874
In all but two cases (using Logistic Regression and
either 75 or 200 features), FCR is the worst performer
by a clear margin.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 26233  EndNode: 26438
This leads us to
state that the set of FOS techniques, while diverse in their
selections for the feature subsets, will perform similarly to
each other in terms of classi?cation (with the exception of
FCR).
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 27325  EndNode: 27486
In terms of similarity, we ?nd that each ranker in the
FOS family of techniques will create diverse feature subsets
when compared to other members of the family.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 31402  EndNode: 31535
If one ignores Fold Change ratio,
then the difference between the best ranker and the worst
has a maximum of 0.03080 in terms of AUC.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 31536  EndNode: 31665
As for the top
performers, we ?nd that SAM followed by Signal-to-Noise
are commonly the top performers within all three learners.
