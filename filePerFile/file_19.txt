Good categorization performance was achieved using 
a statistical classifier and a proportional assignment strat- 
egy.

If a syntactic parse of text is available, then features 
can be defined by the presence of two or more words in 
particular syntactic relationships. We call such a fea- 
ture a syntactic indexing phrase.

Syntactic phrase indexing and term clustering have op- 
posite effects on the properties of a text representation, 
which led us t o  investigate combining the two techniques 
[3].

Our first data  set was a set of 21,450 Reuters newswire 
stories from the year 1987 [4]
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 6776  EndNode: 6887
A primary concern of ours was to  examine the effect 
of feature set size on text categorization effectiveness.
Label: OTHER  StartNode: 8506  EndNode: 8695
We investigated phrasal and term clustering methods 
only on the Reuters collection, since the smaller amount 
of text made the MUC-3 corpus less appropriate for clus- 
tering experiments.

We experimented with forming clusters from 
words under three metafeature definitions, and from 
phrases under eight metafeature definitions 141. 
Label: METODE  StartNode: 12731  EndNode: 12830
We first looked a t  effectiveness of proportional assign- 
ment with word-based indexing languages
Label: OTHER  StartNode: 14258  EndNode: 14399
We 
show the breakeven point reached for categorization runs 
with various size sets of words, again on both the Reuters 
and MUC-3 data sets

We 
checked for overfitting directly by testing the induced 
classifiers on the training set.

Finally, since features with a higher value on expected 
mutual information are selected first, we intuitively ex- 
pect features with lower ratings, and thus appearing only 
in the larger feature sets, to simply be worse features.

 In earlier work on the 
CACM collection \[3\], we identified lack of training data 
as a primary impediment to high quality cluster forma- 
tion.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 22003  EndNode: 22337
 We have also shown, via studying text cate- 
gorization effectiveness, a variety of properties of index- 
ing languages that are difficult or impossible to measure 
directly in text retrieval experiments, uch as effects of 
feature set size and performance of phrasal representa- 
tions in isolation from word-based representations.
