Classification of data becomes difficult because of unbounded 
size and imbalance nature of data. Class imbalance problem 
become greatest issue in data mining

Imbalance problem occur 
where one of the two classes having more sample than other 
classes

There are different methods available 
for classification of imbalance data set which is divided into 
three main categories, the algorithmic approach, data-
preprocessing approach and feature selection approach

In 
this paper systematic study of each approach is define which 
gives the right direction for research in class imbalance problem.

 In imbalance data set the 
class having more number of instances is called as major 
class while the one having relatively less number of 
instances are called as minor class [16]

 various techniques have been proposed to solve the 
problems associated with class imbalance [9], which 
divided into three basic categories, the algorithmic 
approach, data-preprocessing and feature selection 
approach.

 Finally, this paper 
suggests that applying two or more technique i.e. hybrid 
approach gives better solution for class imbalance 
problem.
