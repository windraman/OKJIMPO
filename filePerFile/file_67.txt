However, we are faced
with the problem of translation ambiguity, i.e. multiple
translations are stored in a dictionary for a word.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 709  EndNode: 777
In addition, a
word-by-word query translation is not precise enough.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 880  EndNode: 1022
First, as many as possible,
noun phrases are recognized and translated as a whole by using
statistical models and phrase translation patterns.

With the explosion of on-line non-English documents, cross-
language information retrieval (CLIR) systems have become
increasingly important in recent years.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1678  EndNode: 1855
In particular, dictionary-based translation has
been a commonly used method because of its simplicity and the
increasing availability of machine readable bilingual dictionaries.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 2542  EndNode: 2656
Second, to deal with the translation ambiguity problem, we
propose a method based on statistics of co-occurrences.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 2766  EndNode: 2924
Finally, to
increase the coverage of the bilingual dictionary, additional
words and translations are automatically generated from a
parallel bilingual corpus.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 9008  EndNode: 9098
It is carried out in a
bottom-up manner: we first identify base NPs, and then complex
NPs.

In this section, we present the results of our CLIR experiments
on TREC Chinese corpora.

In summary, the improvement by using NP translation for short
queries is statistically significant (p-value = 0.015).
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32658  EndNode: 32764
The addition
of translation selection is also statistically significant for long
queries (p-value = 0.05).
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32765  EndNode: 32983
The improvement obtained with the
combination of both approaches (i.e. NP translation and
translation selection) are statistically significant for both short
queries (p-value = 0.03) and long queries (p-value = 0.001).
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32984  EndNode: 33144
The
comparison with the MT approach shows that at least for short
queries, the improvement brought by our methods is statistically
significant (p-value = 0.02).
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 38230  EndNode: 38345
The combination of our approach with the MT
system leads to a high effectiveness of 105% of that of
monolingual IR.
