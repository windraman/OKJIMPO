However, the output of such systems tend to be noisy, and
hence it is crucial to be able to estimate the quality of the ex-
tracted information.

We present Expectation-Maximization
algorithms for automatically evaluating the quality of the ex-
traction patterns and derived relation tuples.

A fundamental problem in information extraction is how
to train an extraction system for an extraction task of inter-
est.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1844  EndNode: 2060
An
attractive approach to reduce the training cost, pioneered by
Brin [3], is to start with just a handful of “seed” tuples for the
relation of interest, and automatically discover extraction pat-
terns for the task.

We present gen-
eral Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms for estimat-
ing pattern and tuple confidence.

Our goal is to extract structured relations between named en-
tities (e.g., a company name, a location name, or a name of
a drug or a disease) from unstructured documents with min-
imal human effort.

Snowball extracts a re-
lation from text by starting with just a handful of exam-
ple tuples for the relation.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 6521  EndNode: 6692
After gener-
ating extraction patterns for a target relation and a document
collection, Snowball scans the collection documents to dis-
cover new tuples using Algorithm 1.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 15887  EndNode: 16056
We used three relations ex-
tracted from a collection of 145,000 articles from the New
York Times from 1996, available as part of the North Amer-
ican News Text Corpus1.

As we can see, both NB-EM and VS-EM-Spy
perform on par with the Constraint method on this task.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 19688  EndNode: 19843
As we conjectured,
for this relation (which lacks true integrity constraints), the
EM-based methods have higher accuracy than the constraint-
based method.

As we can see in Figure 7,
Snowball variations with no specific tuning for DiseaseOut-
breaks produce results that are comparable with those for
Proteus.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 21183  EndNode: 21317
In fact, Snowball manages to achieve recall that is
substantially higher than that of Proteus while maintaining
competitive precision.

A partially supervised approach for extracting relations was
pioneered by DIPRE [3], and extended by others (e.g., ref-
erences [1, 14, 13, 9]).
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 22613  EndNode: 22909
We showed that our
general EM-based confidence estimation method improves
extraction accuracy over heuristic-based methods, allowing
a partially supervised relation extraction system to achieve
accuracy comparable to a sophisticated manually tuned state-
of-the-art information extraction system.
