The widely known binary relevance method for multi-label
classification, which considers each label as an independent binary prob-
lem, has been sidelined in the literature due to the perceived inadequacy
of its label-independence assumption

This paper shows that binary relevance-based methods have much to of-
fer, especially in terms of scalability to large datasets

We exemplify this
with a novel chaining method that can model label correlations while
maintaining acceptable computational complexity.

In total we use 12 datasets, with dimensions ranging from 6 to 983 labels, and
from less than 1,000 examples to almost 100,000.

Using a variety of multi-label datasets and evaluation measures, we carried
out empirical evaluations against a range of algorithms. Our classifier chains
method proved superior to related methods, and in an ensemble scenario was
able to improve on state-of-the-art methods, particularly on large datasets.
