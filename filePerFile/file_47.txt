In this paper we propose a novel relation extraction 
method, based on grammatical inference.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 268  EndNode: 418
Following a semi-
supervised learning approach, the text that connects named entities 
in an annotated corpus is used to infer a context free grammar.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 575  EndNode: 764
Evaluation results show that the 
proposed approach performs comparable to the state of the art, 
while exhibiting a bias towards precision, which is a sign of 
conservative generalisation.

Relation extraction is the task of identifying the relations that hold 
between interesting entities in text data.

In this paper, a supervised machine learning approach is 
proposed.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1658  EndNode: 1819
Assuming the existence of a named entity recogniser 
(NERC), the proposed approach extracts binary relations between 
named entities already identified in texts.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2257  EndNode: 2376
The main aim of this paper is to examine the suitability of 
grammatical inference for the task of relation extraction.

The approach presented 
in this paper concentrates on extracting binary relations from 
textual corpora, by trying to capture the linguistic evidence in the 
text that connects two related entities.

For the purposes of the evaluation, annotated corpus from the 
BOEMIE research project was used.

All pages have been manually annotated, according to a 
semantic model capturing information about athletes and their 
participations in sports competitions, held under official 
competitions.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 19297  EndNode: 19482
Evaluation results suggest that the proposed approach performs 
well in comparison to the state of the art, despite the difficulties of 
comparing results obtained on different corpora.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 25742  EndNode: 26108
In addition, the fact that the proposed approach 
does not involve any abstraction other than the generalisation 
performed by the grammatical inference algorithm, allowed us to 
get an estimate of the degree of generalisation that can be achieved 
by the algorithm. This was measured to be at least 10 pp 
accompanied with a degradation in precision of about 29 pp.
