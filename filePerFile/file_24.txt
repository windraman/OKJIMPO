Document 
segmentation plays a significant role in document analysis, 
because every day, millions of documents including technical 
reports, government files, Newspapers, books, magazines, letters, 
bank cheque, etc,. have to be processed.

This paper presents the implementation of bottom up approach 
to segment the document image into homogenous regions based 
on geometric structure. 
Label: METODE  StartNode: 5979  EndNode: 6177
The proposed approach reduces the computational complexities 
of supporting procedure after document segmentation such as 
OCR system for processing text regions and for processing non 
text region.

From the above comparative analysis it is observed that 
classification accuracy produced by multilayer perceptron is 
higher than naïve bayes and J48.
