We present here a simple
two-stage method for extracting complex
relations between named entities in text.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2327  EndNode: 2413
Very little work has been done
in recognizing and extracting more complex rela-
tions.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 9803  EndNode: 9897
This method works by first fac-
toring all complex relations into a set of binary re-
lations.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 9898  EndNode: 9993
A classifier is then trained in the standard
manner to recognize all pairs of related entities.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 9994  EndNode: 10134
Fi-
nally a graph is constructed from the output of this
classifier and the complex relations are determined
from the cliques of this graph.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 12208  EndNode: 12346
Instead of trying to classify all possible relation
instances, in this work we first classify pairs of en-
tities as being related or not.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 12347  EndNode: 12468
Then, as discussed in
Section 4.2, we reconstruct the larger complex rela-
tions from a set of binary relation instances.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 16835  EndNode: 16992
Instead of having the system re-
turn all cliques, our system just returns the maximal
cliques, that is, those cliques that are not subsets of
other cliques.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 21762  EndNode: 21954
Our data set consists of 447 abstracts selected
from MEDLINE as being relevant to populating a
database with facts of the form: gene X with vari-
ation event Y is associated with malignancy Z.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 25503  EndNode: 25703
First we observe that the maximal clique method
combined with maximum entropy (system MC) re-
duces the relative error rate over naively enumer-
ating and classifying all instances (system NE) by
21%.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 25734  EndNode: 25885
The system based
on binary factorization not only is more efficient
then naively enumerating all instances, but signifi-
cantly outperforms it as well.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 28148  EndNode: 28305
We showed that such a method can be suc-
cessful with an empirical evaluation on a large set
of biomedical data annotated with genomic varia-
tion relations.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 28306  EndNode: 28435
In fact, this approach is both signifi-
cantly quicker and more accurate then enumerating
and classifying all possible instances.
