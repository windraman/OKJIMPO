Motivated by the commonly used faceted search interface
in e-commerce, this paper investigates interactive relevance
feedback mechanism based on faceted document metadata.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 332  EndNode: 485
In this mechanism, the system recommends a group of docu-
ment facet-value pairs, and lets users select relevant ones to
restrict the returned documents.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 486  EndNode: 621
We propose four facet-
value pair recommendation approaches and two retrieval
models that incorporate user feedback on document facets.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 622  EndNode: 961
Evaluated based on user feedback collected through Amazon
Mechanical Turk, our experimental results show that the
Boolean filtering approach, which is widely used in faceted
search in e-commerce, doesn’t work well for text document
retrieval, due to the incompleteness (low recall) of metadata
assignment in semi-structured text documents.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1444  EndNode: 1615
A personalized search or filtering system usually suffers
from the “cold start” problem, where the system performs
poorly when it has little training data about new users.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2138  EndNode: 2298
We aim to study a new inter-
active user feedback mechanism that helps retrieval systems
learn more about user information needs with limited user
interactions.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2749  EndNode: 2865
This motivates us
to explore whether we can adapt the faceted search idea to
the general purpose document retrieval.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 4359  EndNode: 4646
In this mechanism, instead of letting users pro-
vide relevance feedback on documents or create structured
queries actively, the system suggests faceted constraints (in
the form of facet-value pairs) and users can choose interest-
ing facet-value pairs to improve the returned documents.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 4733  EndNode: 4785
First, how to recommend facet-
value pairs to users.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 5092  EndNode: 5157
Secondly, we study how to use
user faceted feedback in retrieval.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 5448  EndNode: 5494
Thus we also propose a soft re-
trieval model.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 5495  EndNode: 5600
In this model, a document that meets a users
elected faceted constraint gets a certain number of credits.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 16927  EndNode: 17101
To evaluate the proposed faceted feedback mechanism, we
use two TREC filtering track datasets: the medical article
collection OHSUMED and the news story collection RCV1
[14].
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 22706  EndNode: 22848
The average MAP and P@10 of using faceted feed-
back on OHSUMED dataset are improved by 32.4% and
43.9% over the baseline (BM25) respectively.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 22849  EndNode: 22934
The average
MAP and P@10 on RCV1 dataset are improved by 11.1%
and 8.8% respectively.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 26543  EndNode: 26623
The Boolean A+O works
better than Boolean AND while still worse than Boolean
OR.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 32054  EndNode: 32220
Table 6 shows that FF per-
forms better than PRF, and closely to RRF on OHSUMED
dataset; FF performs worse than PRF and RRF on RCV1
dataset, and 10% better than BM25.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 34872  EndNode: 35036
The proposed soft model
is shown consistently more effective on both datasets, as it
automatically learns a weight for each facet, which captures
the facet quality.
