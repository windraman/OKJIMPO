In this
work, we propose to use a training corpus made up by a set of Query-
Relevant Document Pairs (QRDP) in a probabilistic cross-lingual infor-
mation retrieval approach which is based on the IBM alignment model
1 for statistical machine translation.

Therefore, the develop-
ment of novel techniques for managing of data, especially when we deal with
information in multiple languages, is needed.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 2765  EndNode: 3000
In Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), the usual approach is to
first translate the query into the target language and then retrieve documents in
this language by using a conventional, monolingual information retrieval system.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 3267  EndNode: 3390
Since our perspective, the above two-step approach is too sensitive to trans-
lation errors produced during the first step.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 3391  EndNode: 3519
In fact, even if we have a very
accurate retrieval system, translation errors prevent correct retrieval of rele-
vant documents.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 3520  EndNode: 3771
To overcome this drawback, we propose to use a set of queries
with their respective set of relevant documents as an input training set for a
direct probabilistic cross-lingual information retrieval system which integrates
both steps into a single one.

This is done on the basis of the IBM alignment
model 1 (IBM-1) for statistical machine translation [6].

The corpus reduction
was based on the use of a technique for selecting mid-frequency terms, named
the Transition Point (TP), which was used in other research works with the
same purpose [9,10].

We have used a subset of the EuroGOV corpus for the evaluation of the QRDP
model.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 12572  EndNode: 12788
As can be seen, an improvement
by using an evaluation corpus was obtained employing the TP technique with
a neighbourhood of 40%, which is exactly the same percentage used in other
research works (see [10] and [13]).

We may observe that by using the same information from a web page, we
have slightly outperformed the results obtained by other approaches, even when
we have trained our model with only 3 target web pages in average per query,
and executing 100 iterations on the Expectation-Maximization model.

The QRDP model uses a statistical dictionary of
associated words directly to rank documents according to their relevance with
respect to the query.
