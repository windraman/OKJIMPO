Most of the texts one comes across are composed of a number of topics, perhaps varying in their relevance
to one another and their scope.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 781  EndNode: 944
A system that could automatically detect these subtopics would certainly be useful,
allowing the reader to quickly skip to the topics most relevant to her purpose.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1756  EndNode: 1881
Thus, any
highly accurate segmentation system would certainly be useful in these times of overly abundant, undocumented
data.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 2400  EndNode: 2566
The approach used in this
paper is based on Hearst’s TextTiling algorithm, a moving window approach that uses lexical overlap as a means of
detecting topic coherence.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 3272  EndNode: 3400
First, it divides the input text into
sequences of relevant tokens and calculates the cohesion at each potential boundary point.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 3402  EndNode: 3558
It then uses these
cohesion scores to produce depth scores for each potential boundary point that has a lower cohesion than the
neighboring boundary points.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 3560  EndNode: 3755
Using these depth scores, the algorithm is able to select boundary points where the
depth is low relative to the other depth scores, indicating that that gap represents a topic shift in the text.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 3757  EndNode: 3933
The output
is the text file with boundaries inserted at these gaps with sufficiently high depth scores, delineating the various
topics by breaking at the least cohesive points.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 9351  EndNode: 9462
Evaluation of the system’s performance consists of
running the system on a concatenation of newspaper articles.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 11385  EndNode: 11514
The best precision score was 0.77 when run on the New York Times texts, and it was
accompanied by a recall score of 0.77 as well.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 11516  EndNode: 11754
While these scores may sound relatively impressive, it is important to
note that they were only numerically evaluated on this one set of data, and so it is unlikely that those parameters
would return such high scores in all circumstances.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 14094  EndNode: 14322
While this system fails to perform as well as many
of the other segmentation systems that have recently been presented in the literature, it is certainly on the right path
and can produce good results with the proper parameters.
