With the worldwide growth of the Internet, research on Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) is
being paid much attention.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 512  EndNode: 660
Existing CLIR approaches based on query translation require parallel corpora
or comparable corpora for the disambiguation of translated query terms.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 661  EndNode: 729
However, those natural
language resources are not readily available.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 1052  EndNode: 1157
In the experiments, our method
achieved 97% of manual translation case in terms of the average precision.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 4576  EndNode: 4710
One of the major technical problems to be solved in CLIR
concerns the translation of short queries of one or few
words, appropriately.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 4711  EndNode: 4826
Possible translation-candidates might
be numerous in such cases and resolving such ambiguities
becomes a hard task.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 4827  EndNode: 5131
In this paper, we propose a novel approach for CLIR
system targeting Web documents, which uses a natural
language resource that is extracted from a Web search
engine as a corpus, and resolves the ambiguities caused by
the dictionary-based query translation approach, by using a
co-occurrence information.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 10160  EndNode: 10289
The obtained
translation-candidates are disambiguated, using term co-
occurrence statistics and then passed to the search engine.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 10290  EndNode: 10379
A query submitted by a user is first segmented into words
using a morphological analyzer.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 10380  EndNode: 10472
Then, each word is
translated into the target language using a machine-
readable dictionary.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 11390  EndNode: 11575
For instance, the
number of retrieved documents by searching some terms
combined by AND operators, can be regarded as a co-
occurrence frequency of those terms in a Web document
corpus.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 20648  EndNode: 20737
For the test data, we used NACSIS Test Collection 1
(NTCIR-1)[17] (Research Purpose Use).
Label: DATA  StartNode: 21604  EndNode: 21855
For query translation, we merged three dictionaries,
Japanese-English Bilingual Dictionary and Technical
Terms Dictionary (Information Processing) of EDR
Electronic Dictionary Version 1.5[19] and EDICT, which is
a freeware Japanese-English dictionary.

We chose AltaVista as the Web
search engine for the query disambiguation for the
following reasons:
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 26463  EndNode: 26635
In terms of average precisions compared with NODIS, the
proposed disambiguation method improved 1.0 point for
NTCIR and 0.8 point for NEAR, but decreased 0.7 point
for AND.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 30103  EndNode: 30245
In this experiment, differences of the average precisions
among four measures were lower than 0.1% and no
significant difference was observed.
