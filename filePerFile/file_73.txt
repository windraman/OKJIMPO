The 
backbone is an Information Retrieval (IR) system based on a 
search engine and a multilingual module based on statistical 
machine translation of documents.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 559  EndNode: 679
To this system is added a 
Query Expansion (QE) module which mainly uses linguistic 
resources to perform the expansion.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1238  EndNode: 1385
However standard queries, containing 2-3 terms in average, are 
less and less likely to be sufficient to retrieve all of the relevant 
documents.  
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1386  EndNode: 1556
Consequently, advanced techniques are necessary to 
enhance the performances of Information Retrieval (IR) 
systems, such as Cross Language Information Retrieval 
(CLIR).
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1670  EndNode: 1814
Bridging the gap between document and query languages 
requires the application of machine translation techniques to 
queries, indices, or both.
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1815  EndNode: 1915
Translation software can induce 
linguistic differences between translated data and human 
language.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1916  EndNode: 1988
Our proposal is to overcome this problem by using 
Query Expansion (QE).
Label: METODE  StartNode: 1989  EndNode: 2043
QE consists in adding new words to 
the initial query.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 2129  EndNode: 2254
In a nutshell, our key 
idea is to combine QE with CLIR in a Multilingual Multimedia 
Information Retrieval (MMIR) prototype.

In this section we use the OPF set of queries described in 
section II.E.2.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 23367  EndNode: 23512
More than half of the queries of the complete OPF corpus, 
including words with spelling mistakes, URLs, etc. are 
expanded into several choices.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 23757  EndNode: 23866
It is worth noticing that the 
quantity of words provided by QE is unevenly spread across 
different queries.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 24145  EndNode: 24255
Silence reduction, which is the first aim of the proposed 
method, is significant as the results in IV.B show.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 24405  EndNode: 24499
Indeed, the expansions shown in section IV.B.1 do 
maintain the meaning of the original query.
