The prior knowledge about
the rhetorical structure of scientific abstracts
is useful for various text-mining tasks such
as information extraction, information re-
trieval, and automatic summarization.

 METHOD: Formalizing
the categorization task as a sequential label-
ing problem, we employ Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRFs) to annotate section la-
bels into abstract sentences.
Label: abstract  StartNode: 1176  EndNode: 1436
RESULTS: The pro-
posed method outperformed the previous
approaches, achieving 95.5% per-sentence
accuracy and 68.8% per-abstract accuracy.
CONCLUSION: The experimental results
showed that CRFs could model the rhetor-
ical structure of abstracts more suitably.

We can survey the problems, purposes, motivations,
and previous approaches of a research field by read-
ing texts in background sections of scientific papers.

 Given an unstructured ab-
stract without section labels indicated by boldface
type, the proposed method annotates section labels
of each sentence.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the role of adrenergic signal transmission in the control of renal erythropoietin (EPO) pro-
duction in humans.

The previous work saw the task of labeling as a text
categorization that determines the class label yi for
each sentence xi

We design three kinds of features to represent each
abstract sentence for CRFs.

We constructed two sets of corpora (‘pure’ and ‘ex-
panded’), each of which contains 51,000 abstracts
sampled from the abstracts with structured sections.

The CRF clas-
sifier had roughly 5% advantage on per-abstract ac-
curacy over SVM.
