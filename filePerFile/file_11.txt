This paper presents a new method for extracting
meaningful relations from unstructured natural lan-
guage sources. T
Label: METODE  StartNode: 360  EndNode: 632
 The method is based on informa-
tion made available by shallow semantic parsers.
Semantic information was used (1) to enhance a
dependency tree kernel; and (2) to build semantic
dependency structures used for enhanced relation
extraction for several semantic classifiers.

With the advent of the Internet, more and more information
is available electronically.

To evaluate the role of shallow semantics provided by se-
mantic parsers on relation extraction we have used the Auto-
matic Content Extraction (ACE) corpus available from LDC
(LDC2003T11). The data consists of 422 annotated text doc-
uments gathered from various newspapers and broadcasts.
Five entity types have been annotated (PERSON, ORGANI-
ZATION, GEO-POLITICAL ENTITY, LOCATION, FACILITY)
along with the 24 types of relations.

The results indicate that
on average, for K4, the best performing kernel, we obtained
an increase of 24.66% in the F-score when features provided
by the semantic parsers were added. When relying on SDTs,
the average Precision that was obtained was 89.3%, the re-
call was 76.4%, thus an F-score of 82.35%, when using the
same data as [1].

The re-
sults show that frame semantics produce an enhancement of
53.24% over previous state-of-art results in relation extrac-
tion. Furthermore, they show that semantic representations
such as frames or predicate-argument structures have a wider
impact on classification performance than the classification
technique.
