Previous comparisons of document and 
query translation suffered difficulty due to 
differing quality of machine translation in 
these two opposite directions.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 375  EndNode: 519
We avoid 
this difficulty by training identical statistical 
translation models for both translation di- 
rections using the same training data.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 520  EndNode: 759
We in- 
vestigate information retrieval between En- 
glish and French, incorporating both trans- 
lations directions into both document trans- 
lation and query translation-based informa- 
tion retrieval, as well as into hybrid sys- 
tems.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 760  EndNode: 917
We find that hybrids of document 
and query translation-based systems out- 
perform query translation systems, even 
human-quality query translation systems.

Should we translate the documents or the 
queries in cross-language information re- 
trieval?
Label: PROBLEM  StartNode: 1794  EndNode: 1969
Translating 
the documents into the query's language(s) 
and translating the queries into the docu- 
ment's language(s) represent wo extreme 
approaches to coupling MT and IR.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 5557  EndNode: 5742
The present work avoids 
this difficulty by using statistical machine 
translation systems for both directions that 
are trained on the same training data us- 
ing identical procedures.

We built and compared three information 
retrieval systems : one based on document 
translation, one based on query translation, 
and a hybrid system that used both trans- 
lation directions.
Label: METODE  StartNode: 6194  EndNode: 6342
In fact, the "score" of a 
document in the hybrid system is simply the 
arithmetic mean of its scores in the query 
and document ranslation systems.

The document sets used in our experiments 
were the English and French parts of the doc- 
ument set used in the TREC-6 and TREC- 
7 CLIR tracks.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 9068  EndNode: 9201
The English document 
set consisted of 3 years of AP newswire 
(1988-1990), comprising 242918 stories orig- 
inally occupying 759 MB.
Label: DATA  StartNode: 9202  EndNode: 9359
The French doc- 
ument set consisted of the same 3 years of 
SDA (a Swiss newswire service), compris- 
ing 141656 stories and originally occupy- 
ing 257 MB.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 18067  EndNode: 18267
We ob- 
serve that the hybrid systems which combine 
query translation and document translation 
outperform both query translation and doc- 
ument translation individually, on both sets 
of documents.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 19553  EndNode: 19640
Surprisingly, we 
find that the hybrid system outperforms the 
pure monolingual system.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 20329  EndNode: 20590
We find no 
clear advantage for either the query trans- 
lation system or the document translation 
system; instead French=eeEnglish translation 
appears advantageous over English~French 
translation, in spite of identical procedures 
used in constructing both.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 20591  EndNode: 20683
However a hy- 
brid system incorporating both directions 
of translation outperforms either.
Label: HASIL  StartNode: 20684  EndNode: 20856
Further- 
more, by incorporating human query trans- 
lations rather than machine translations, 
we show that the hybrid system contin- 
ues to outperform query translation.
